	abstract = {Mobile payment is receiving growing attention globally, from consumers to merchants, as an alternative to using cash, check, or credit cards. The potential of this technology is enormous. This study aims to identify the main determinants of mobile payment adoption and the intention to recommend this technology. We advance the body of knowledge on this subject by proposing an innovative research model that combines the strengths of two well-known theories; the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) with the innovation characteristics of the diffusion of innovations (DOI), with perceived security and intention to recommend the technology constructs. The research model was empirically tested using 301 responses from an online survey conducted in a European country, Portugal. Data was analyzed using the structured equation modeling (SEM). We found compatibility, perceived technology security, performance expectations, innovativeness, and social influence to have significant direct and indirect effects over the adoption of mobile payment and the intention to recommend this technology. The relevance of customer's intention to recommend mobile payment technology in social networks and other means of communication was also confirmed, supporting the recommendation to include it in social marketing campaigns and in future technology adoption studies. For researchers this study provides a basis for further refinement of individual models of acceptance. For practitioners, understanding the key constructs is crucial to design, refine, and implement mobile payment services, applications, and products that achieve high consumer acceptance, value, and high rates of positive recommendations in social networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of technology and diversification of payment methods, mobile payment methods have gradually replaced traditional cash payments and become the mainstream payment mode. Although mobile payment is more convenient, is it faster than cash payment when their physical differences are controlled? Does it affect consumer behavior? We designed two studies to explore these questions. In Study 1, we required 192 participants to physically pay by cash or mobile phone and measured their willingness to pay (WTP). In Study 2, we compared the speed of the two payment methods when the physical differences between them were eliminated and measured consumers' willingness to buy from 46 students. Our results indicated that the effect of mobile payment, which increases WTP, also applies to specific products, and it does not occur if the money is a gift, as opposed to if it is earned. Moreover, when the process of cash payment is made as easy as mobile payment, people still spend less time on mobile payments than cash payment, and mobile payment effect is impacted by payment time. The above results supplement the evidence that payment methods have an impact on consumer behavior, and provide consumers, merchants, and regional managers with suggestions on payment methods. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {To date, cash on delivery (COD) is one of the most popular payment methods in developing countries thanks to the blossom of customer-to-customer e-commerce. With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people's daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue. In particular, we propose a multi-session mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and transparent across delivering sessions in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism ensure the efficiency of delivering process. The authors release our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. We conclude that the integration of multi-session mechanism and blockchain technology will cause significant efficiency across several disciplines. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper explores the reasons behind the slow uptake of mobile payment (m-payment) from a switching intention (SI) perspective. The antecedents of SI from cash to m-payment were explored using an integrated conceptual model of the push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework and the status quo bias (SQB) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered survey was used to collect data, which are empirically tested using SmartPLS 3.0. Findings: The push factor was found to have an insignificant effect on SI to m-payment whereas the pull factor was significant. Furthermore, the results revealed that the two mooring variables have contrasting results as trust is not a significant determinant of SI to m-payment while perceived security and privacy (PSP) is. Additionally, all SQB-related relationships were found to be statistically significant Originality/value: This study determined the factors that play vital roles in the consumers' decision-making to transition from cash to m-payment. This was done via a uniquely developed conceptual model that incorporated the PPM framework with the SQB perspective. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Financial services can help drive development. They help people escape poverty by facilitating investments in their health, education, and businesses. And they make it easier to manage financial emergencies-such as a job loss or crop failure-that can push families into destitution. A growing body of research reveals many potential development benefits from financial inclusion-especially from the use of digital financial services, including mobile money services, payment cards, and other financial technology (or fintech) applications. Although the evidence is somewhat mixed, even studies that do not find positive results often point to possibilities for achieving better outcomes through careful attention to local needs.1 Many poor people around the world lack the financial services that can serve these functions, such as bank accounts and digital payments. Instead, they rely on cash-which can be unsafe and hard to manage. That's why the World Bank has made it a key priority to promote financial inclusion-access to and use of formal financial services. Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to expand it. In 2011 the World Bank launched the Global Findex database, theworld's most comprehensive database on how adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risks. Compiled using nationally representative surveys in of more than 150,000 adults age 15 and above in over 140 economies, the 2017 Global Findex database includes updated indicators on access to, and use of, formal and informal financial services. It has additional data on the use of financial technology, including the use of mobile phones and the Internet to conduct financial transactions. The 2017 Global Findex is the third survey round, following the initial one and a second one in 2014. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, using a CBDC is costly for agents. I study the optimal monetary policy when only cash, only a CBDC, or both cash and a CBDC are available to agents. If the cost of using a CBDC is not too high, more efficient allocations can be implemented by using a CBDC than using cash, and the first best can be achieved. Having both cash and a CBDC available may result in lower welfare than in the cases where only cash or only a CBDC is available. The welfare gains of introducing a CBDC are estimated under various scenarios for the United States and Canada. For example, if the cost of using a CBDC relative to cash is around 0.25% of the transaction value, introducing a CBDC can lead to an increase of 0.12–0.21% consumption for the United States and 0.04–0.07% for Canada. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

By using estimates of passenger boarding times with alternative fare payment methods (cash, magnetic strip, contactless card and off-board payment), we calculate operational speed and benefits of upgrading the fare payment technology, including savings on fleet size requirements, fuel and labour cost, travel time for users and air pollution.

However, access to cash is not always guaranteed, especially in rural regions. The present study is based in the Ávila region of Spain. A parameter called the "access to cash index" is constructed here. It is used to detect rural areas where the ability to access cash and banking services is more difficult. Based on the "access to cash index", two sustainable solutions are proposed: The first (in the short term), based on extending access to cash, takes advantage of the existing pharmacy network. With this measure, a notable reduction of more than 55% of the average distance required to access this service is verified here. The second is based on the implementation of a central bank digital currency. Here, the results show an acceptance of 75%.

Such a circumstance would require the development of training and information policies on the safety and effectiveness of this type of currency. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define and explore the concept of financial supply chain strategy in a global business environment. The paper aims to illustrate the concepts with a detailed case study of Motorola's global financial supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: This is a detailed, longitudinal case study analysis of a focal organisation and its economic partners in a financial supply chain. The case study combines qualitative analysis of the strategy evolution with extensive time-series data and quantitative analyses of the performance of the financial supply chain. Findings: The financial supply chain is an integral component of Motorola's overall supply chain management strategy. Physical product, information systems and financial flows are closely aligned with each other throughout the supply chain incorporating Motorola, its customers, suppliers and banks. The overall trend is towards the development of an integrated global financial supply chain in which cash flows mirror product flows. Motorola shares financial data with its suppliers as part of a cooperative strategy that generates cost savings for Motorola and its suppliers in areas such as foreign exchange and cash balances. The cooperative strategy also improves the quality of the payments process measured by six sigma techniques and produces strategic benefits such as risk reduction for the supply chain as a whole in areas such as foreign exchange and payments. A strategy of this type is only possible by taking a global perspective of the financial supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The development of financial supply chains has not been fully addressed in the supply chain management literature. This paper defines this relatively new topic area and explains its significance in its own right, and also in terms of the inter-relationships between finance and manufacturing supply chains. A research agenda for financial supply chains is proposed that describes a range of new research opportunities in this area. Practical implications: The development of integrated financial supply chains will lead to significant savings in terms of funding, banking and administrative costs associated with treasury and payment activities. The implementation and nature of the strategic change also highlight important strategic planning and implementation issues associated with financial supply chains. Originality/value: The strategic importance of financial supply chains for business and academic researchers is demonstrated through the definition of this topic and the application of a research framework to a detailed study of Motorola's global financial supply chain using time-series data of strategy evolution and financial supply chain performance. The research findings and comparison with theory support the assertion that this is a relatively new and unexplored problem area that is of direct relevance and interest to researchers in supply chain management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Thus, this paper aims to investigate the main determinants of mobile payment use intention and proposes a model of mobile payment adoption, integrating mindfulness as a major factor. Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study were collected through an online survey of a representative sample of 414 users in the United States and 380 in Spain. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to verify the validity of the variables and the relationships among them. Findings: The results showed that mindfulness, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, subjective norms and attitude have significant influence on mobile payment use intention. Research limitations/implications: The present study is based on samples from only the United States and Spain, which limits generalization of the results. The notion of mindfulness is new in mobile payment adoption research, so future studies should analyze in more detail and in depth its effect on these adoption processes. Originality/value: This is the first study to incorporate mindfulness into a mobile payment adoption process. Incorporating mindfulness complements traditional variables to show how users address the adoption process (e.g. novelty seeking, engagement, anxiety, attention paid). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study develops a push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework to interpret medical consumers’ switching behavior. A field survey was executed in Taiwan to collect data from medical consumers. The results of 1020 valid questionnaires revealed that low satisfaction, perceived risk, social influence, relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, and image have positive influences on switching intention; on the other hand, sunk costs, inertia, and switching costs negatively influence consumers’ switching intention. The results provide useful insights that not only help service providers choose an appropriate promotion strategy but also enable smartphone manufacturers, bankers, and medical institution managers to develop and appropriate their future marketing and administrative strategies. © 2021},

	abstract = {Central banks worldwide have started researching and developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In the digital economy context, concerns regarding the integrity, competition, and privacy of CBDC systems have also gradually emerged. Against this backdrop, this study aims to evaluate users’ willingness to use China’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system, a digital payment and processing network, and its influencing factors by comprehensively considering and comparing the characteristics of cash and third-party payment services. Combining the push-pull-mooring framework (PPM) and task-technology fit (TTF) theory, we discuss the scenarios and mechanisms that may inspire users’ DCEP adoption intention through an empirical study. The results reveal that privacy concerns regarding the original payment methods and technology-task fitting level of DCEP positively impact users’ willingness to adopt DCEP. The technical characteristics of DCEP, users’ payment requirements, and government support positively affect users’ adoption intention by influencing the task-technology fitting degree of DCEP. Switching cost significantly and negatively impacts adoption intention, whereas relative advantage exhibits no significant effect. This research contributes to a better understanding of the factors that influence switching intentions and the actual use of DCEP, and provides policy guidance on promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of DCEP. © 2023, The Author(s).},

In this paper, we present the results of a field experiment in Afghanistan that was designed to increase adoption of mobile money, and determine if such adoption led to measurable changes in the lives of the adopters. The specific intervention we evaluate is a mobile salary payment program, in which a random subset of individuals of a large firm were transitioned into receiving their regular salaries in mobile money rather than in cash. We separately analyze the impact of this transition on both the employer and the individual employees. For the employer, there were immediate and significant cost savings; in a dangerous physical environment, they were able to effectively shift the costs of managing their salary supply chain to the mobile phone operator. For individual employees, however, the results were more ambiguous. Individuals who were transitioned onto mobile salary payments were more likely to use mobile money, and there is evidence that these accounts were used to accumulate small balances that may be indicative of savings. However, we find little consistent evidence that mobile money had an immediate or significant impact on several key indicators of individual wealth or well-being. Taken together, these results suggest that while mobile salary payments may increase the efficiency and transparency of traditional systems, in the short run the benefits may be realized by those making the payments, rather than by those receiving them.},

	abstract = {Fog computing can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that enables transactions and resources at the edge of the network. In the paradigms of fog computing, the fog user (outsourcer) with resource-constraint devices can outsource the distributed computation tasks to the untrusted fog nodes (workers) and pays for them. Recently, plenty of research work has been done on fair payments. However, all existing solutions adopt the traditional e-cash system to generate payment token, which needs a trusted authority (i.e. a bank) to prevent double-spending. The bank will become the bottleneck of the payments system. In this paper, we propose a new fair payment scheme for outsourcing computations based on Bitcoin. Due to the advantages of Bitcoin syntax, the users can transact directly without needing a bank. Besides, the proposed construction can guarantee that no matter how a malicious outsourcer behaves, the honest workers will be paid if he completed the computing tasks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, Cash-on-Delivery (COD) payment method still prevails in cash-based economies. Although COD allows consumers to be more proactive in making payments, it still appears to be vulnerable by the appearance of a third party (shipping companies). In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on "smart contract" implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract. We also provided a detailed implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our model. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

We focus on the proximity mobile payment, which is made feasible by the near-field communications (NFCs) technology. Building upon the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM), a behavioral intention model was established consisting of enhanced cognitive antecedents as well as affective and social antecedents. Cognitive antecedents encompass the factors including relative advantage, perceived usefulness and ease of use in the TAM, and technology characteristics (e.g., responsiveness and mobility); affective antecedents focus on positive and negative emotions associated with using NFC mobile payments. Both antecedents are expected to affect attitudes. In addition, social antecedents examine subjective norms and the influence of network externalities. Data were collected from 394 adult nonusers of NFC mobile payments in the United States via an online survey. The research model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results showed that all three antecedents significantly affected individual consumers’ intention to adopt NFC mobile payments, explaining a significant amount of variance. Both theoretical and marketing implications are discussed in the context of NFC mobile payments. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

When supported by an appropriate consumer financial protection framework, digital payments enable confidential and convenient financial services, which can be especially important for women. By shifting government wages and social transfers into accounts, governments can lead by example. Digitizing G2P payments has the potential to dramatically reduce costs, increase efficiency and transparency, and help recipients build familiarity with digital payments. Digital wage and social transfer payments can also provide the onramp to financial inclusion and in many cases the first account that the recipient has in her own name and under her control. However, digitizing G2P payments is not without its challenges. Most importantly, digitization may require significant up-front investments in building an adequate physical payment infrastructure that is able to process such payments, as well as a financial identification system and a consumer protection and education framework to ensure that recipients have safe, reliable, and affordable access to the digital payment system. © The Author 2017.

This finding, in turn, explains why consumers express higher willingness to pay (WTP) when paying with credit cards. The current study introduces mobile technology as a new payment method to this literature. Specifically, it highlights convenience as a positive driver of increased WTP for mobile payment. However, for consumers to perceive mobile payment as convenient, a personal adoption (enabled through an existing system in the respective country market) is necessary. A set of three studies across several country markets tests these assumptions empirically. Convenience emerges as a new mediator between mobile payment and increased WTP, contingent on personal adoption. These findings thus extend extant literature on the mechanisms consumers use with different payment methods, and they offer differentiated recommendations regarding payment channels for country managers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

While mobile payment is already the dominant payment type in Asia, it is still in its infancy in Europe despite a high mobile phone penetration rate and service providers' considerable investments in the technology. Mobile payment is therefore a recent example of the puzzle of abundance—a phenomenon describing a situation in which the potential of a new disruptive technology is not tapped by the masses even though it offers substantial benefits to them. In this study, we address this puzzle by investigating the factors influencing the intention to use a disruptive technology. We draw on the example of mobile payment and develop and test a refined technology acceptance model. Results indicate that the intention to use mobile payment services is positively affected by perceived usefulness, perceived compatibility, perceived personal innovativeness, and perceived social influence, but is negatively affected by perceived risk. Both perceived costs and perceived risk mitigate the positive impact of several other characteristics. Our findings provide points of leverage to better tap the potential of mobile payment in contexts such as Europe. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study of 200 shop-keepers in Mumbai and Bengaluru, we found that cash shortage increased digital payment adoption but that digital payments fell after new banknotes became available. Digital payment adoption depended on the nature and scope of transactions, type of product sold, as well as personal factors specific to business owners such as comfort and familiarity with other digital technologies and online transactions. Using theoretical work on market and information behavior, we examined environmental pushes for technology adoption against prevalent transactional practices, trust, and control. We propose that the move toward digital payments must be framed within a larger undertaking of technology-driven modernity that drives these initiatives, rather than just the efficiency or productivity gains digital payments present. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

Removing this trust assumption comes at the significant cost of transaction privacy. A number of academic works have sought to improve the privacy offered by ledger-based currencies using anonymous electronic cash (e-cash) techniques. Unfortunately, this strong degree of privacy creates new regulatory concerns, since the new private transactions cannot be subject to the same controls used to prevent individuals from conducting illegal transactions such as money laundering. We propose an initial approach to addressing this issue by adding privacy preserving policy-enforcement mechanisms that guarantee regulatory compliance, allow selective user tracing, and admit tracing of tainted coins (e.g., ransom payments). To accomplish this new functionality we also provide improved definitions for Zerocash and, of independent interest, an efficient construction for simulation sound zk-SNARKs. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.},

	abstract = {Microeconomic optimisation of scheduled public transport operations has traditionally focused on finding optimal values for the frequency of service, capacity of vehicles, number of lines and distance between stops. In addition, however, there exist other elements in the system that present a trade-off between the interests of users and operators that have not received attention in the literature, such as the optimal selection of a fare payment system and a designed running speed (i.e., the cruising speed that buses maintain in between two consecutive stops). Alternative fare payment methods (e.g., on-board and off-board, payment by cash, magnetic strip or smart card) have different boarding times and capital costs, with the more efficient systems such as a contactless smart card imposing higher amounts of capital investment. Based on empirical data from several Bus Rapid Transit systems around the world, we also find that there is a positive relationship between infrastructure cost per kilometre and commercial speed (including stops), achieved by the buses, which we further postulate as a linear relationship between infrastructure investment and running speed. Given this context, we develop a microeconomic model for the operation of a bus corridor that minimises total cost (users and operator) and has five decision variables: frequency, capacity of vehicles, station spacing, fare payment system and running speed, thus extending the traditional framework. Congestion, induced by bus frequency, plays an important role in the design of the system, as queues develop behind high demand bus stops when the frequency is high. We show that (i) an off-board fare payment system is the most cost effective in the majority of circumstances; (ii) bus congestion results in decreased frequency while fare and bus capacity increase, and (iii) the optimal running speed grows with the logarithm of demand. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {There is an active debate about the potential costs and benefits of emerging “smart mobility” systems, especially in how they will serve communities already facing transportation challenges. This paper describes the results of an assessment of these equity issues in the context of lower-income areas of Portland, Oregon, based on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research. The study found that by lowering costs and improving service for public transit, ridesharing and active transportation, smart mobility systems could address many of the needs of transportation disadvantaged communities. Similar to those found in other case studies, significant barriers prevent smart mobility technologies from benefiting all communities. For example, lower income survey respondents and respondents of color had significantly lower access to the “smart mobility ecosystem” including bank accounts and credit cards, they rely more heavily on paying cash for transit tickets, had lower access to internet at home and work, and were more likely to reduce data use or cancel cell plans because of cost or data restrictions. Respondents were also concerned about information security, as the impacts of loss or theft, especially identity theft can be devastating for lower-income residents. Since integrating payment systems and relying on internet and cell data for mobile applications is a core feature of smart mobility ecosystem, these disparities are significant barriers to the equitable transition to smart mobility. Policy recommendations to address barriers include expanding free and public WiFi, better real-time transit information, improved training, and language translation for phone applications, among other things. © 2019 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

Design/methodology/approach: A four-city, three language, paper and pencil survey yielded a sample of 600 respondents from India. Data were analyzed using structural equations modeling. Findings: This study finds that AR positively mediates the relationship between TR and intention to adopt (IA) mobile payments. More importantly, PCs negatively moderate the relationship between AR and IA. Research limitations/implications: Results will vary depending on country and other variables outside the scope of this study such as perceived risk, trust, etc. The sample was large but mainly comprised males, between 18 and 35 years of age. Practical implications: The cash shortage due to a recent demonetization move in India had spurred mobile payment adoption but usage and retention remained low. Many other banking self-service technologies had not been successful and digitization was critical for easing payments and potentially paving the way for mobile banking. However, using mobile phones for financial transactions raises PCs that attenuate the positive impact of AR. Also, understanding overall attitudes with TR is important in a rapidly digitizing country with relatively novice users. Social implications: Adoption of mobile payment technology can help address social and economic challenges in India, such as financial inclusion, corruption and tax evasion. Given the increasing awareness of privacy issues in India, mobile payment adoption, which already faces acquisition and retention challenges, will likely to face greater resistance in the future. Originality/value: The findings add to the literature on emerging markets and marketing of technology products by identifying the critical role of privacy in the adoption of financial technology services. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that given the rapid introduction of technology in India, consumers’ overarching TR has to be considered along with AR for mobile payments. Thus, the authors offer a tripartite, customer–technology–transaction view of the mobile payment adoption process in India. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We conducted ethnographic fieldwork, interviews with drivers and collected online and social media comments before, during and shortly after the introduction of cashless fares. We explore how drivers and passengers were fearful of the change due in part to a lack of information and communication, the anticipation of negative effects on vulnerable passengers and a compromise in freedom, flexibility and surveillance. We highlight the ways cashless payments can alter the social function of money, create new forms of work for drivers and passengers, and if not carefully introduced can cause emotional stress and fears of state surveillance and control. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable public debate over the effect of interchange fees on credit card transactions. Regulators in Australia and Europe have argued that these fees can be set by banks to have an anticompetitive effect. In the US, it has been argued that these fees, together with a rule that prevents a surcharge for credit purchases, might create a cross subsidy between cash and credit customers. Academics have noted that, in particular circumstances, interchange fees have no real effects in the absence of such a no-surcharge rule. This paper demonstrates that the potential neutrality of interchange fees is a general result. We show that in the absence of a no surcharge rule or, alternatively, if there is perfect competition at the merchant level, interchange fees can be changed without leading to any real effects. This result does not depend on the degree or nature of competition at either the bank or the merchant level. We conclude that the elimination of no surcharge rules may provide practical policy solutions for authorities concerned about the level of interchange fees.},

The present study develops a new research model used for the prediction of the most significant factors influencing the decision to use m-payment. To this end, the authors have carried out a study through an online survey of a national panel of Spanish users of smartphones. Two techniques were used: first, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine which variables had significant influence on mobile payment adoption; in a second phase, the neural network model was used to rank the relative influence of significant predictors obtained by SEM. This research found that the most significant variables impacting the intention to use were perceived usefulness and perceived security variables. On the other side, the results of neural network analysis confirmed many SEM findings, but also gave slightly different order of influence of significant predictors.

	abstract = {The purpose of the research is to analyze the formation and development of Von Hayekʼs theory of private money and its application in the conditions of the digitalization. The theory of private money and the concept of political economy may become the fundamental basis for the circulation and pricing of central banks digital currencies (CBDC) in the near future. In this case, central planning should solve the problem of distributing money among different segments of the population, in order to avoid a significant amount of private money in well-off segments of the population. Hayekʼs concept supports the introduction of an unconditional basic income (Zwolinski, 2019), where fixed amounts of government payments are distributed to all citizens through a monetary system, which is relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes that the international nature of digital currencies will make both developing and developed economies vulnerable to “digital dollarization”, when the national currency is replaced by the currency of the digital platform. Digitalization of money increases the importance of competition between private and public money. In the digital economy, cash can actually disappear, and payments can center around social and economic platforms, weakening traditional monetary policy channels. Governments may to ask central banks to use CBDC in order to maintain monetary policy independence. The article confirms that stable digital money is preferable for foresight, calculation and accounting. Hayek supported the idea of the manipulating the amount of money to stabilize the purchasing power. © А.Ю. Михайлов, 2021},

	abstract = {The construction industry has long been plagued with late and nonpayments. Despite the desired benefits of payment automation and today's increased access to digitized progress data, too often payment applications still rely on inefficient workflows and documents that are time-consuming to prepare, review, approve, and execute. This paper argues that current payment applications, even if computerized, cannot support reliable automation of progress payments due to their reliance on centralized control mechanisms and lack of guaranteed execution. The paper examines why blockchain-based and decentralized smart contracts can address these limitations. It explores the conceptual underpinning for the design of an automated payment system and investigates the role of smart contracts in enabling reliable and autonomous conditioning of cash flow on product flow status. To illustrate these points, a use case is presented for smart contract-based progress payments in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle-based progress monitoring. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges facing blockchain-based payment automation and the broader implications for dispute resolution and construction law informatics, namely zero-trust computing and the creation of an auditable single source of truth for projects.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

A total of 766 sample respondents were surveyed using a pre-tested questionnaire. The empirical validation of the framework and analysis was done using partial least squares (PLS)-structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings: The results suggest that the behavioral intention (BI) to use and innovation resistance (IR) affect the usage of digital payment systems. The relation between BI to use digital payment systems and the AU of digital payment systems is moderated by the stickiness to cash payments. Research limitations/implications: This cross-sectional study is limited by geographic constraints and highlights the AU of digital payment systems by using the UTAUT 2 and IR theory only during the demonetization period. Practical implications: This study offers valuable insights to the economists, policymakers and digital payment service providers regarding the usage of digital payment systems by consumers during demonetization. Originality/value: This study assumes importance as it empirically examines the influence of BI and IR on the AU of digital payment systems during the demonetization period in India.

This shift has led to a series of policy debates driven in part by consumers' choice of payment instruments. Using a new nationally representative survey, we transform consumer responses to open-ended questions into product rankings and estimate a characteristics-based rank-order logit model in order to quantify consumer substitution among payment methods. Our estimates are then used to conduct supply-driven and demand-driven counterfactual experiments in order to estimate market share and cost effects. From a counterfactual experiment in which merchants stop accepting credit cards, we predict merchant costs to decline substantially. Because merchants accept credit cards nonetheless, we regard our finding as evidence either that the credit card networks hold market power, or that merchants experience unmeasured intangible benefits from credit card acceptance. We also predict that contactless debit will take market share from cash, checks, and credit, and that the age/cohort effect alone is unlikely to cause debit card use to increase substantially over a 10-year period. © 2007.},

Three empirical studies building on prospect theory show that positive comparisons of basket prices with mental budgets trigger favorable OSPI judgments. The study also investigates the effects of cash, card, and mobile payments on OSPI formation following Soman's (2003) payment transparency concept. Results show that mobile payment, as an innovative payment option, leads to more positive OSPI judgments.

As many forms of cybercrime are motivated by profit, a solid cash-out strategy is required to ensure that crime proceeds end up with the criminals themselves without an incriminating money trail. The authors examine how cybercrime proceeds can be laundered using services that are offered on the Dark Web. Design/methodology/approach: Focusing on service-percentages and reputation-mechanisms in underground bitcoin laundering services, this paper presents the results of a cash-out experiment in which five mixing and five exchange services are included. Findings: Some of the examined services provide an excellent, professional and well-reviewed service at competitive cost. Whereas others turned out to be scams, accepting bitcoin but returning nothing in return. Practical implications: The authors discuss what these findings mean to law enforcement, and how bitcoin laundering chains could be disrupted. Originality/value: These cash-out strategies are increasingly facilitated by cryptocurrencies, mainly bitcoin. Bitcoins are already relatively anonymous, but with the rise of specialised bitcoin money laundering services on the Dark Web, laundering money in the form of bitcoins becomes available to a wider audience. © 2018, Rolf van Wegberg, Jan-Jaap Oerlemans, Oskar van Deventer.},

Acquisitions with the same means of payment but different sources of transaction funding are in fact quite distinct. Acquisitions financed with internally generated funds significantly underperform those financed with debt. The takeover financing decision is influenced by the bidder's pecking order preferences, its growth potential, and its corporate governance environment, all of which are related to the cost of external capital.

	abstract = {Mobile payments are the future as we move towards a cashless society. In some markets, cash is already being replaced by digital transactions, but consumers of many developing countries are slower in transition towards digital payments. This study aims to identify major determinants of consumer mobile payment adoption in India the country with second largest mobile subscribers in the world. Existing mobile payments adoption studies have predominantly utilised Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was primarily developed in organisational context and criticised for having deterministic approach without much consideration for users’ individual characteristics. Therefore, this study adapted meta-UTAUT model with individual difference variable attitude as core construct and extended the model with consumer related constructs such as personal innovativeness, anxiety, trust, and grievance redressal. Empirical examination of the model among 491 Indian consumers revealed performance expectancy, intention to use, and grievance redressal as significant positive predictor of consumer use behaviour towards mobile payment. Moreover, intention to use was significantly influenced by attitude, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The major contribution of this study includes re-affirming the central role of attitude in consumer adoption studies and examining usage behaviour in contrast to most existing studies, which examine only behavioural intention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Since its inception, mobile payment is rapidly gaining popularity over the years, and starting to replace traditional modes of payment. The usage of mobile payments has further escalated following various precautionary measures (i.e. social distancing) in curbing the transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, most of the elderlies are still sceptical about the usage of mobile payment services. The current study was set to investigate the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers that resulted in elderlies' resistance towards using such services. The impact of stickiness to cash was also examined as a moderator on the investigated relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Online survey questionnaires were used to collect the responses from 400 elderly consumers at the age of 60 and above. Data analysis was then performed using the SPSS and AMOS statistical software packages. Findings: Findings obtained acknowledged the significance of functional (i.e. perceived complexity, perceived incompatibility and perceived cost), psychological (i.e. lack of trust, inertia, and technological anxiety) and risk (i.e. privacy risk, security risk, financial risk and operational risk) barriers in influencing resistance towards mobile payment services among the elderlies. Consequently, resistance would influence their attitude and non-adoption intention; with attitude as the mediator between resistance and non-adoption intention. Finally, moderation analysis also confirmed the moderating effect of stickiness to cash towards elevating the correlation between resistance and non-adoption intention. Originality/value: This study is one of the very few studies that explored the minimally investigated territory on the consequential importance of mobile payment usage among the elderlies, specifically, through extending the literature on the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers towards the individuals' resistance. Besides, this study also successfully contributed to existing body of knowledge by highlighting the mediating role of attitude and moderating role of stickiness to cash in the interrelationships between resistance, attitude and non-adoption intention. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In doing so it contributes to the body of literature exploring how the social meanings of money impact on practice. We describe the findings of an ethnographic study examining loan collection workflows, where bank loans given to auto-rickshaw drivers to purchase their auto-rickshaw are overseen and managed by an intermediary. We found that making the mobile money service usable for the drivers took considerable work and was largely achieved because it was embedded in the wider, trusted, loan payment ecosystem. Although Airtel Money promises anytime, anywhere payments, payment remains time and place bound for the drivers. It is tempting to take a transactional approach to payments, and indeed we initially approached the problem of enabling frequent payments as one of payment mechanism. However, in practice payments are embedded in sets of social relations and a socio-technical ecosystem. It takes considerable collaborative work, and a fair amount of flexibility, to enable these financially vulnerable drivers to pay off their loans, and reducing the issue to one of payment mechanism alone does not tell the full story. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been an interest in creating practical anonymous electronic cash with the ability to conduct payments of exact amounts, as is typically the practice in physical payment systems. The most general solution for such payments is to allow electronic coins to be divisible (e.g., each coin can be spent incrementally but total purchases are limited to the monetary value of the coin). In Crypto'95, T. Okamoto presented the first efficient divisible, anonymous (but linkable) off-line e-cash scheme requiring only O(logN) computations for each of the withdrawal, payment and deposit procedures, where N = (total coin value)/ (smallest divisible unit) is the divisibility precision. However, the zero-knowledge protocol used for the creation of a blinded unlinkable coin by Okamoto is quite inefficient and is used only at set-up to make the system efficient. Incorporating “unlinkable” blinding only in the setup, however, limits the level of anonymity offered by allowing the linking of all coins withdrawn—rather than a more desirable anonymity which allows only linking of subcoins of a withdrawn coin. In this paper we make a further step towards practicality of complete (i.e., divisible) anonymous e-cash by presenting a solution where all procedures (set-up, withdrawal, payment and deposit) are bounded by tens of exponentiations; in particular we improve on Okamoto's result by 3 orders of magnitude, while the size of the coin remains about 300 Bytes, based on a 512 bit modulus. Moreover, the protocols are compatible with tracing methods used for “fair” or “revokable” anonymous cash. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

However, there is a gap in understanding whether this technology has the potential for sustainable development that encompasses individual emancipation and environmental growth beyond social and economic change. To evaluate mobile payments role in sustainable human-centric development, we develop a framework based on the theories by two influential development economists—Schumacher and Sen (Schumacher 2011; Sen 2001). The framework includes features like the low-cost technology, easy implementation and operability, usefulness to local people, and scope for creative appropriation. We conducted an in-depth field study through interviews with merchants and consumers to evaluate the framework. We triangulate our findings with publicly available secondary survey data. Our findings indicate that along with the features like low-cost, easy installation and operability, users reported that the mobile payment technology, unlike cash transactions, can also afford creative uses such as reflection on past expenses. The paper contributes to the field of ICT4D with the framework that can be used by future studies. The investigation reveals developmental implications towards the need for greater inclusion of local small-scale vendors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To investigate when, where, and for what amount customers use different forms of payment an interview of statistically representative group of 1005 consumers from all over Poland have been realized, in the first quarter of 2019 with the use of the computer assisted personal interviewing method. The data gives a unique combination of information on consumers payment choice and detailed information about demographics, income, and consumer preferences within a nationally representative consumer survey. Within this article statistical analyzes of the influence of transaction factors on consumer choice of payment have been performed together with a first attempt to employ a data-mining method known as Random Forests for predict the choices that those consumers make regarding the method of payment. The results revealed the complexity and diversity of factors influencing consumer choices. The findings show that, despite the development of innovative forms of payment, traditional forms, especially cash, still have a strong position. Notwithstanding among the customers' personal traits, financial knowledge is one of the most important determinants of their payment choices. These results are an important step toward a predictive model of consumer choice. Additionally presented findings on consumers’ payment behavior can guide policy formulation and strategic decision-making of central banks and stakeholders, and thereby contribute toward improving the efficiency of the payment system in Poland as a whole. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The present study aims to examine the situation of near field communication (NFC) m-payment services along with the determinants of users’ continuance intention. To this intent, a sample of 1840 respondents with experience in using NFC payments participated in an online survey. During the first phase of this research, an structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was used to identify the acceptance predictors of mobile payments as well as to analyse the eventual moderating effect of the gender and age of the users of this tool. The second phase focused on the neural network model’s proficiency in assessing the relative impact of the most relevant predictors stemming from the aforementioned SEM analysis. The results obtained revealed subjective norms, risk, perceived usefulness, customer brand engagement and trust as the most significant antecedents of continuance intention towards NFC payments. The study also discusses the managerial implications derived from this research while assessing and suggesting potential user behaviour-based business opportunities for service providers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {All known methods for transferring electronic money have the disadvantages that the number of bits needed to represent the money after each payment increases, and that a payer can recognize his money if he sees it later in the chain of payments (forward traceability). This paper shows that it is impossible to construct an electronic money system providing transferability without the property that the money grows when transferred. Furthermore it is argued that an unlimited powerful user can always recognize his money later. Finally, the lower bounds on the size of transferred electronic money are discussed in terms of secret sharing schemes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1993.},

These systems, which effect real-time transfers of monetary base among bank accounts, add management of intraday liquidity to the duties traditionally performed by central banks, and require new, ad hoc policy instruments. The paper presents a simple model of a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system, which is used to analyze the reaction of banks and monetary policy variables to this new environment. It is shown that if daylight liquidity is costly, a network externality may induce banks to postpone payment activity, thereby affecting the quality of the information available to counterparts for cash management purposes. The increased noise may in turn induce higher than optimal levels of banks' end-of-day reserve holdings, relative to a social optimum, with adverse effects on expected profits. The rise of a daylight market for funds, predicted by the model, does not solve the mentioned externality problem. Some corrective policy measures are discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach: An online experiment was conducted crossing two levels of incentive types (cash back and discount), two levels of incentive amounts (5 and 10 percent), and two levels of incentive promotion periods (one and three months). A total of eight treatment conditions plus one control group comprised the 2×2×2 factorial design. A sample of 463 subjects with no prior experience with NFC mobile payment was recruited using a Qualtrics panel. Findings: This study found that: the availability of financial incentives had a positive effect on intention to adopt NFC mobile payment; financial incentives indirectly affected intention through perceived risk; and while different types, amounts or promotion periods did not seem to matter for those in the low perceived risk group, the main effect of promotion period and the interaction effect between amount and promotion period were significant for those in the high perceived risk group. Research limitations/implications: The study sample was limited from 18 to 35 age group, which could have affected the varied effect of the different attributes of incentives that were examined. Originality/value: This study is the first to give some empirical evidence about the impact of financial incentives on NFC mobile payment adoption. The results provide insight to providers as well as retailers offering the incentive payment option. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It uses comparative empirical experiments (Charrette Test Method) to draw comparisons between the visibility of state-of-practice and blockchain-enabled payment systems in a commercial construction project. Comparisons were drawn across four levels of granularity. The findings are threefold: 1) blockchain improved information completeness and information accuracy compared with the digital state-of-practice solution; 2) the improvements were significantly more pronounced for information queries that had higher product, trade, and temporal granularity; and 3) blockchain-enabled solution was robust when faced with more granular information queries, while the conventional solution experienced 50% and 66.7% decline respectively in completeness and accuracy of information.

The arguments in favour of reducing cash usage must be seen relative to the costs of digital payments, for both society and individuals. The drastic demonetization episode in India, which removed 86 per cent of the value of notes in circulation at one stroke in November 2016, was partly justified in terms of forcing a shift to cashless transactions. However, such a shift requires that adequate infrastructure be in place in terms of banking and connectivity, both of which are currently lacking in India. The article also identifies other concerns with digital transactions including higher costs and the possibilities of loss of privacy, fraud, identity theft and surveillance. The obsession with digital transactions as a marker of social and material progress is misplaced; it may become yet another means by which finance extracts rentier incomes out of relatively poor populations. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies},

	abstract = {Dematerialization is an ongoing process in today's generation of intelligent, digital products; content becomes disengaged from fixed carriers, and flows freely through networks and devices. We have witnessed how music CDs and cash money have been replaced by MP3 files and digital payments, as well as how dematerialization has entered the field of books. In this study, the process of dematerialization is explored. We define it and focus on its benefits and drawbacks, while trying to find answers to the question of how to design dematerialized products without neglecting the rich values of the physical world. Regarding this, we take a look at the approach of Tangible Interaction, and find it inspirational. Subsequently, in two design cases of an audio system and a payment terminal, we lay the foundations for our own design approach, which is situated in between the Tangible Interaction approach and the approach that is applied in today's generation of digital products. Finally, our approach is placed within the context of the Rich Interaction paradigm. © 2013 Van Campenhout, Frens, Overbeeke, Standaert and Peremans.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Consumers in India are increasingly using mobile payment systems (MPSs) to make online and offline payments. Digital payment applications are gradually being used as surrogates for cash, checks and plastic money. The motive behind this research is to analyze the different antecedents that impact the users' willingness to continue using the MPS in India. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive study of the literature review supports the creation of a framework that describes the continuance intention of using MPS. Data from a survey of 612 respondents from India were collected to assess the research model. The study used partial least squares (PLS)–structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to empirically validate the framework developed. Findings: The outcomes of the research suggest that service quality, attitude, effort expectancy and perceived risk act as influencing antecedents of continuance intention to use MPS. Determinants like perceived trust, convenience and social value have no influence on users' continuance intention. SEM analysis has verified the proposed model, which explains 50.7% of the variance of the users' continuance intention of using MPSs. Research limitations/implications: The research is built upon cross-sectional data carried out in India. Hence, the outcomes of the study are limited to this region only. Practical implications: Engaging with the consumers for a long time and enabling their continuance usage are extremely important for firms offering mobile payment services. The managerial implications provide insights into the different ways to capture new business opportunities to the firms rendering mobile payment services in the wake of changing consumer behavior. Originality/value: This research tries to analyze users' continuance intention to use MPS in India. Although many research studies have investigated the willingness of the individuals to adopt novel technology in different frameworks, there are hardly any empirical studies carried out to analyze the antecedents of users' continuance intention to use MPSs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Moreover, Bank Indonesia is running a program to increase the awareness of society to become cash-less. One of the e-payment that emerging in Indonesia is Go-Pay, a Go-Jek payment system. Go-Pay successfully becomes one of the fifth largest e-money in Indonesia less than a year of its operation. Therefore, Bank Indonesia awarded Go-Jek as the most active company that increase society's awareness in conducting non-cash transactions in 2017. The successful of Go-Pay creates opportunities to upgrade the positions of Go-Pay service by knowing factors that influence its customers in continuing using Go-Pay services. This study intended to analyze factors influencing continuance intention of Go-Pay adoption in Indonesia by using a Modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) Model with Trust as a new variable. The data were gathered from 507 valid respondents in Indonesia chosen by purposive sampling technique. The result revealed that the factors influence continuance intention adoption of Go-Pay from the highest to the lowest respectively are Habit, Trust, Social Influence, Price Saving Orientation, Hedonic Motivation, and Performance Expectancy. The model can predict strongly the continuance intention of consumers towards Go-Pay services in Indonesia since the R                             2                              is 72.8%.

If banks have market power in the deposit market, a CBDC can enhance competition, raising the deposit rate, expanding intermediation, and increasing output. A calibration to the US economy suggests that a CBDC can raise bank lending by 1.57% and output by 0.19%. These crowding-in effects remain robust, albeit with smaller magnitudes, after taking into account endogenous bank entry. We also assess the role of a non-interest-bearing CBDC as the use of cash declines. © 2023, University of Chicago Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the major problems of e-commerce globally is the selling and buying of goods among the parties over the Internet in which the traders may not trust their partners. Cash on delivery allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their home or a location they choose. This is sometimes called a payment system because customers receive goods before making a payment. This paper investigates a critical verification process issue in the cash on delivery system. In particular, we propose a multi shippers mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and trustworthy verification across participants in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism is given to not only ensure the benefits of the seller but also prevent shipper's fraudulent. The solution leverages the consistency and robustness of decentralized markets where trust is flexible and effectively controlled. To demonstrate the application and implementation of the proposed framework, we conduct several case studies on real-world transaction datasets from a local computer retailer. We also provide our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. Our conclusion is that the continued integration of multi-shipper mechanism and blockchain technology in the decentralized markets will cause significant transformations across several disciplines. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

	abstract = {Digital content transactions through e-commerce will grow tremendously in the coming years. In this respect, well-designed electronic payment schemes and high-quality digital contents are two critical factors. Untraceable electronic cash schemes make it possible for customers to pay the e-cash to the merchants through communication networks under privacy protection. Therefore, there is a need to invent new electronic payment protocols with strong cryptographic algorithms that will eventually replace present day paper-based cash schemes. There have been two types of electronic cash schemes, namely on-line and off-line. In general off-line schemes are more efficient than on-line ones. The two fundamental issues with any off-line electronic cash scheme have been the detection of double-spending and provision of anonymity. This paper proposes a new untraceable off-line electronic cash scheme which can maintain anonymity and double spender detection and possesses strong fraud control capabilities. Moreover, the proposed scheme attaches expiration date to coins so that the banking system can manage its databases more efficiently. The scheme is based on cryptographic techniques such as ElGamal and blind signatures. The coins produced by the scheme can be transferred through computer networks into storage devices and vice versa so that portability is assured. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

We provide an estimate of the potential savings in social cost and determine the responsiveness of payment users when relative prices are used to speed up the substitution of electronic for paper-based payments. While some countries (Norway, Japan) have encouraged their banking systems to establish explicit prices to promote electronic payments, others (the United States) have not. For the first time ever, survey data are available to permit estimation of a model of payment choice from which own price, cross price, and payment substitution elasticities are derived. The data, which are semiannual panel data, concern the use of three methods for making retail payments in Norway: cash withdrawals at ATMs, writing a check, or using a debit card at the point of sale. Our finding that payment users are quite sensitive to relative prices that reflect the relatively lower cost of electronic payments is generalizable. Both production techniques and consumer needs for payment instruments are very similar across developed countries, even though instrument usage differs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A society's potential economic gains from replacing cash-based payments with electronic payments are large, and mobile payments may help this transition. The purpose of this paper is to understand consumers' attitudes on start using mobile payment services. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds on quantitative data from a proof of concept test of a mobile payment service that was done in Sweden in 2011. The theoretical foundation rests on technology adoption models (TAM) and diffusion of innovation theories. Findings: The study finds that the most important factor explaining whether consumers are likely to use a mobile payment service is ease of use. In addition, relative advantage, high trust, low perceived security risks, higher age and lower income were associated with a positive view on adopting the service. Research limitations/implications: The results leads to the conclusion that studies of innovation in the payment industry cannot rely on TAM and innovation diffusion theory alone. Theories on learning, network economies and value-creation must also be included if change processes in payment systems are to be fully understood. Practical implications: Companies aiming to launch mobile payment services must understand that consumers' put high importance on reliability of such services and that trust in services is built via learning process. If consumers learn to use the service, the probability they also start to trust it increases. This means that the launch of services must be designed as learning processes for consumers and merchants. Originality/value: The newness in this paper is, first, that the TAM model is tested quantitatively in a regression analysis using data from Sweden, and, second, that the traditional theories used to explain consumers' use of new types of payment services are discussed and suggestions for additional, complementary theories are proposed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a systematic literature review methodology. Findings: The review shows a general consensus that a CBDC is a liability of the central bank and it has cash-like attributes. The review also presents the motivation and benefits of issuing a CBDC such as the need to increase financial inclusion, the need to improve the conduct of monetary policy and to foster efficient digital payments. The review also shows that many central banks are researching the potential to issue CBDCs due to its many benefits. However, a number of studies have called for caution against over-optimism about the potential benefits of CBDC due to the limiting nature of CBDC design and its inability to meet multiple competing goals. Suggested areas for future research are identified such as the need to find the optimal CBDC design that meets all competing objectives, the need for empirical evidence on the effect of CBDC on the cost of credit and financial stability, and the need to find a balance between limiting the CBDC holdings of users and allowing users to hold as much CBDC as they want, and there is a need to undertake country-specific and regional case studies of CBDC design.

	abstract = {With the acceleration of global economic integration and digital economy, cross-border mobile payment has gained growing attention. On the other hand, as COVID-19 keeps on spreading, the popularization of cross-border mobile payment can lower the risk of infection caused by cash payment of tourists. However, though previous researchers already examined mobile payment users’ behavioral intention from different perspectives, these research findings tend to concentrate on the non-cross-border section of mobile payment. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine factors influencing cross-border mobile payment use intention from the user perspective, and combining three theoretical models, chiefly UTAUT2 (extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), ITM (initial trust model), and TTF (task technology fit). In this research, 786 Chinese with the experience of using cross-border mobile payment while traveling to South Korea are adopted as respondents, and the structural equation model is used to empirically analyze the data of these research samples. The study found that initial trust, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price value, task technology fit, and initial trust have significant effects on use intention. Research findings of this paper can deepen people’s understanding of users’ intention to use cross-border mobile payment, and provide theoretical support for the development of cross-border mobile payment. © 2021 by the authors.

This research aims to replicate the credit card effect and to extend this effect to mobile payments. In four empirical studies, of which three online studies and one lab study (total n = 692), we manipulated payment methods (i.e., cash, credit cards, and mobile payments) and measured spending behavior (i.e., WTP and basket value). Across four studies, we did not replicate the credit card effect on either measure of spending behavior, suggesting the effect in the literature may be inflated or may have been fading away. A meta-analysis of the relevant literature revealed the expected credit card effect but also showed that the credit card effect has become weaker through the years and that this effect is contingent on the location of data collection. We also did not find evidence that the credit card effect extends to mobile payments on either measure of spending behavior in the three online studies. However, we found a significant difference between mobile payments and cash on the basket value measure (but not for the WTP measure) in the lab study. This paper also explored whether the pain of payment or payment convenience may be a mechanism underlying the relationship between payment methods and spending behavior. Although the pain of payment tended to be lower and the payment convenience tended to be higher for mobile payments, these effects did not translate into more spending behaviors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, mobile payments have received considerable attention as they are increasingly recognized as a viable alternative to traditional payment systems. However, despite the enormous potential of this technology, the uptake has been slower than expected. In fact, cash is still king in many economies, accounting for up to 90% of all payments in some developing countries. As such, it is increasingly important to understand the determinants of mobile payment acceptance. In this regard, the present study presents a model that focuses on understanding the role of emotions (i.e. affect, anticipated regret, and anxiety) in the acceptance of mobile payment systems. The affective components in the model were drawn from two theories: the social-cognitive theory (SCT) and the regret theory. Using a sample of 325 survey responses from South Africa, the study showed that affect and anticipated regret had a significant positive influence on behavioral intentions to adopt mobile payments, while the influence of anxiety was not significant. The study provides several practical and theoretical implications, especially as the role of emotions in mobile payment acceptance has been widely understudied. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The euro's introduction highlights several shortcomings of cash and coins, and some advantages of paying with plastic, but is hard currency an endangered species, threatened by technologically more advanced means of payments, electronic transfers, e-money and the like? If the last twenty years are any guide, the answer is no. We find that modern payment technologies have little impact on currency usage. To understand this lack of effect, we distinguish between demands for large- and small-denomination banknotes. Competition from existing electronic retail payments' products focuses mostly on small to medium-sized purchases where small bills (less than the £50) are most common. By contrast, there are few signs, nor much likelihood, of past or current electronic products displacing holdings of large bills without government intervention. Large bills, which account for over half the stock of outstanding currency in many OECD nations, are mainly held for hoarding and bad behaviour motives ranging from hard crime to paying the plumber under the table; for such purposes the anonymity of cash is, and is likely to remain, superior. As concerns policy implications, we note that, although issuing large denomination bills facilitates 'bad behaviour', withdrawing big bills is unlikely for political reasons. Governments could try to induce e-money usage as a means of discouraging bad behaviour, but we argue that any attempt to force a complete shift to electronic transfer, and to try to ban, or to prevent, the domestic use of cash would be appallingly illiberal.},

It introduces their current status, and how several countries and currency areas are considering their implementation, following in the footsteps of the Bahamas (which has already implemented them in its territory), China (which has already completed two pilot tests) and Uruguay (which has completed a pilot test). First, the sample of potential candidate countries for establishing a CBDC was selected. Second, the motives for implementing a CBDC were collected, and variables were assigned to these motives. Once the two previous steps had been completed, bivariate correlation statistical methods were applied (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation), obtaining a sample of the countries with the highest correlation with the Bahamas, China, and Uruguay. The results obtained show that the Baltic Sea area (Lithuania, Estonia, and Finland) is configured within Europe as an optimal area for implementing a CBDC. In South America, Uruguay (already included in the comparison) and Brazil show very positive results. In the case of Asia, together with China, Malaysia also shows a high correlation with the three pioneer countries, and finally, on the African continent, South Africa is the country that stands out as the most optimal area for implementing a CBDC. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study proposes a multi-stakeholder framework to enhance fintech use in Africa, aiming to improve financial inclusion and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This article analyzes past research and frameworks built to help stakeholders in developing nations adopt fintech, some of which have been tested in African states with limited success. The study recommends prioritizing national ownership, creating an enabling environment for private sector investment, partnering with multilateral development banks and other stakeholders, fostering innovation and digital literacy, and focusing on cost-effective, non-government-guaranteed financing. In accordance with the G20’s High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion, a country-specific strategy can boost financial technology and digital financial services uptake in Africa. Each government may build a legislative climate that supports innovation and competition, strengthens its digital infrastructure, increases digital literacy and awareness, and collaborates with private sector stakeholders to extend financial inclusion. Partnerships with businesses, international organizations, and other nations can help The Better Than Cash Alliance (TBTCA) promote fintech adoption. Countries can use fintech companies to build and implement national digital payment infrastructure by joining the Alliance. Finally, the mSTAR program advises cooperating with USAID to promote marginalized people, incorporate digital financial services, increase public–private engagement, and educate and train policymakers, practitioners, and technologists. These ideas can help African governments adopt fintech products faster and enhance financial inclusion. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has a tendency to make revolutionary changes for all walks of life with its public, distributed, decentration and unforgeable characteristics. However, with the rapid development of the quantum computer, many extant cryptographic algorithms applied in blockchain-enabled systems are vulnerable to the quantum attacks. In this paper, an anti-quantum blind signature scheme based on the lattice assumption has been proposed. As lattice cryptography is the main candidate algorithm in post-quantum cryptosystems and the blind signature scheme is widely used in e-cash and voting for creating untraceable payment system, which are more suitable for privacy preserving in blockchain-enabled systems. In the proposed scheme, the bimodal Gaussian distribution, Reject sampling and other technologies have been used to improve the security and efficiency. Then, the proposed blind signature can satisfy the properties of blindness and one-more unforgeability, and it also can prove to be safe in the random oracle model. Moreover, the efficiency analysis and comparison results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the similar literatures and has a more stabilized signature size than other cryptosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper explores the advantages and limitations of four types of electronic payment systems: namely, the online credit card payment system, the electronic-cash payment system, the electronic-check payment system, and the smart-card-based electronic-cash payment system. Each payment system was assessed from four perspectives: the technological aspect, the economic aspect, the social aspect, and the regulatory aspect. The requirements of merchants and consumers, the appropriate business environments for each of them to function, and the potential for future expandability were analyzed. The findings of this research could be useful for companies who are planning to adopt or to devote R & D into an electronic payment system.},

The study reveals that the number of registered mobile banking customers has escalated during the COVID-19 era. Mainly government policies regarding different mobile banking transactions such as cash in, cash out, person to person (P2P) transaction, salary and utility bill payments etc., have significantly contributed to rise the people’s digital financial access during this pandemic.

We believe that the main reason is not disbelief in their ability to protect anonymity, but rather the practical limitations in bandwidth and latency that stem from limited participation. This limited participation, in turn, is due to a lack of incentives to participate. We propose providing economic incentives, which historically have worked very well. In this paper, we demonstrate a payment scheme that can be used to compensate nodes which provide anonymity in Tor, an existing onion routing, anonymizing network. We show that current anonymous payment schemes are not suitable and introduce a hybrid payment system based on a combination of the Peppercoin Micropayment system and a new type of "one use" electronic cash. Our system claims to maintain users' anonymity, although payment techniques mentioned previously - when adopted individually - provably fail. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Within any country, the demand for central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be influenced by trends in the level of cash use. While having access to digital currency is more convenient than having to travel to an automated teller machine, this only makes digital currency as convenient as a bank debit card — not better. Demand for digital currency will thus be weak in countries where the adoption of cash substitutes (eg cards, electronic money, mobile phone payments) has suppressed demand for cash. By contrast, where cash use is high due to a lack of substitutes, demand for digital currency should be stronger. Building on the observation that demand for CBDC is tied to the current level of cash use, this paper uses four measures to assess trends in the demand for cash in 11 countries. A tentative forecast of cash use is also made. After showing that declining cash use is largely associated with demographic change, the study ties the level of cash use to the likely demand for CBDC in different countries. In this process, it is suggested that one measure of cash use is more useful than the others. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

Although several pre-paid schemes for date-attachment have been proposed, the interest of e-cash during the withdrawal date and the effective date is ignored. In D-Cash, the interest of e-cash during the withdrawal date and the effective date is addressed for attracting customers to use the pre-paid e-cash schemes, the attachment and management of dates are more simple and flexible than other date-attachment e-cash schemes, and the untraceability property is also preserved. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This article analyzes the monetary policy of major central banks during the economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising public debt in many countries is being financed through asset purchases by monetary authorities. Although these stimulus policies predate the pandemic, they have been significantly boosted as many governments face large financing needs. We have been in a low interest rate environment for years and some governments have issued debt securities at negative rates. In addition, the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain technology, has created greater competition in the international monetary system and many governments have considered the creation of centralized virtual currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We will analyze some relevant cases, with an emphasis on the digital euro project. The methodology is based on the analysis of the evolution of monetary variables. Pearson’s correlation will be used to establish some relationships between them. There is a strong similarity in the expansionary monetary policies of central banks. Although the growth of the money supply has not been passed on to the CPI, it has been passed on to the financial markets and the price of assets such as Bitcoin or gold. © 2021 by the authors.

However, whether it is possible that mobile payment will become a common payment method for consumers depends on the willingness of consumers. This study focuses on the intention from cash payment to mobile payment and adopts a qualitative and quantitative approach based on the theoretical structure of the Transaction Cost & the Push-Pull-Mooring Migration Model of Service Switching. Firstly, the Delphi Method was applied to extract three push variables perceived trouble, perceived lack of transaction records, and difficulty of paying large amounts in cash) and three pull variables (perceived convenience, perceived benefit, and perceived time-saving). After surveying 586 samples, this proposed model was tested with a structural equation modeling approach. Results: 1. the pull facet tends to be more significant than the push facet. 2. Perceived trouble had a significant effect on push factors, while perceived convenience and perceived benefit had a significant effect on pull factors. 3. Push-&-pull factors had significant effect on behavior of gender-&-age. And the-transaction-costs can divide into positive-transaction-costs and negative-transaction-costs after incorporating the Push-Pull-Mooring theory. © 2021 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

	abstract = {Credit card fraud has seen rampant increase in the past years, as customers use credit cards and similar financial instruments frequently. Both online and brick-and-mortar outfits repeatedly fall victim to cybercriminals who siphon off credit card information in bulk. Despite the many and creative ways that attackers use to steal and trade credit card information, the stolen information can rarely be used to withdraw money directly, due to protection mechanisms such as PINs and cash advance limits. As such, cybercriminals have had to devise more advanced monetization schemes towork around the current restrictions. One monetization scheme that has been steadily gaining traction are reshipping scams. In such scams, cybercriminals purchase high-value or highly-demanded products from online merchants using stolen payment instruments, and then ship the items to a credulous citizen. This person, who has been recruited by the scammer under the guise of "work-from-home" opportunities, then forwards the received products to the cybercriminals, most of whom are located overseas. Once the goods reach the cybercriminals, they are then resold on the black market for an illicit profit. Due to the intricacies of this kind of scam, it is exceedingly difficult to trace, stop, and return shipments, which is why reshipping scams have become a common means for miscreants to turn stolen credit cards into cash. In this paper, we report on the first large-scale analysis of reshipping scams, based on information that we obtained from multiple reshipping scam websites. We provide insights into the underground economy behind reshipping scams, such as the relationships among the various actors involved, the market size of this kind of scam, and the associated operational churn. We find that there exist prolific reshipping scam operations, with one having shipped nearly 6,000 packages in just 9 months of operation, exceeding 7.3 million US dollars in yearly revenue, contributing to an overall reshipping scam revenue of an estimated 1.8 billion US dollars per year. Finally, we propose possible approaches to intervene and disrupt reshipping scam services.},

	abstract = {In this paper we set out a three-pillar monetary-financial framework to (i) analyze, categorize and compare past, current and emerging means of payment; to (ii) capture their creation and destruction processes through sectoral balance sheet dynamics; and to (iii) identify the inherent risks to the current monetary-financial system, also known as the fractional reserve banking system. These risks, which stem from sudden shifts in money demand and supply, are as follows: (I) risk of a cashless society; (II) risk of structural bank disintermediation; (III) risk of systemic bank runs; (IV) risk of currency substitution; and (V) risk of economic and financial bubbles. This framework will guide the assessment of the central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which are considered as the next step in monetary evolution. We will analyze two large groups of CBDC proposals: (i) proposals aimed at complementing cash and bank deposits; and (ii) proposals aimed at replacing all bank deposits with CBDCs. We find that once CBDCs are issued in both sets of proposals, there is always a trade-off between low levels of (I), (IV), (V), risks and high levels of (II) risk. This trade-off could also be defined as the CBDC dilemma, which states that in most CBDC proposals it is impossible to have both of the following at the same time: (1) low levels of (I), (IV) and (V) risks; and (2) low levels of (II) risk. Finally, we suggest that further research on CBDCs should focus on the second group of proposals on a phase-in basis in order to also mitigate the structural bank disintermediation risk and hence to overcome the CBDC dilemma. © 2020 by the authors.

The Riksbank was constrained by specie-convertibility requirements for Sweden's currency. Contrary to previous arguments, however, the Enskilda banks did not operate according to free banking theory. The Enskilda banks held Riksbank notes instead of specie as base-money reserves. This arrangement led to a higher supply of formal liquidity than what would have been the case with either a free banking system or a pure deposit-based commercial banking system. The consequence for Sweden was a rapid rate of monetization and financial deepening. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Findings: The key motivators of using mobile payment services include perceived usefulness, convenience, promotional offers, and social approval. In contrast, major barriers to consumer adoption of this mode of payment are lack of trust, limited opportunities for usage, complexity, and habits associated with cash payment. Practical implications: Mobile payment service providers and their partners should make every effort to improve their consumers’ experience. Their marketing communication strategies should incorporate various consumer contact points such as the internet, social media, point-of-purchase communications, TV commercials, and product placement and endorsement.

They are currencies in the sense that they can be exchanged peer-to-peer. They are representations of numbers, i.e. abstract objects. An abstract currency system is a self-enforcing system of property rights over an abstract instrument which gives its owners the freedom to use and the right to exclude others from using the instrument. Cryptocurrency or virtual currency is a cryptographically protected, decentralized digital currency used as a means of exchange. Due to the development of new technologies and innovations, the rate of use of virtual currency is rapidly increasing throughout the globe, replacing not only cash payments and payments by bank transfer, but also electronic cash payments. Among the best-known representatives of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Legal scholars have not yet reached a consensus regarding the nature and legal status of virtual currency. Virtual currency possesses the nature of obligations rights as well as property rights, since it may be both a means of payment and a commodity. Depending on the country, the approach to cryptocurrencies may be different. Today there is already an international cryptocurrency community that does not have a single coordinating center. Only progressive jurisdiction and state regulation of cryptocurrency activity will allow the creation of the conditions that will ensure the implementation of legitimate and safe cryptocurrency relations. © 2018, University of Tyumen.

Moreover, the trade-off between the two properties of liquidity and return is relatively high – to accept higher illiquidity risks, individuals require a more-than-proportional increase in the expected return. In general, the experiments suggest that the future attractiveness of alternative currencies depends on whether the three properties of money are mixed in a way that is consistent with the individual's preferences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Apps like Venmo bring a unique blend of convenience and social interactions into financial transactions. In this paper, we study the role of social relationships in the adoption of the Venmo digital payment system. We collect records of all 91 million public transactions conducted on Venmo since its introduction, a social graph connecting most of its 10.5 million users, and analyze the interplay between social relationships and financial transactions. We find that Venmo communities are very densely connected compared to other interaction networks, and are often driven by specific niche applications. We are able to extract both user-to-user and user-to-vendor transaction communities, and show that they exhibit dramatically different structural properties. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Data is collected from the CBDC Tracker and the WB database for the period 2013–2021. We applied the Pooled OLS estimations to examine the impact of the key factors on being in an advanced stage for issuing CBDC; moreover, probit and logistic regression are employed to robust our results and overcome the limitations of Pooled OLS. The findings demonstrate that underdeveloped economies are more engaged in issuing CBDC. Besides, better regulations, FDI inflow, young populations, and more urban societies would increase the probability of CBDC issuance.

	abstract = {Smartphones are increasingly used for very important tasks such as mobile payments. Correspondingly, new technologies are emerging to provide better security on smartphones. One of the most recent and most interesting is the ability to recognize fingerprints, which enables mobile apps to use biometric-based authentication and authorization to protect security-sensitive operations. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of the fingerprint API in Android, and we show that this API is not well understood and often misused by app developers. To make things worse, there is currently confusion about which threat model the fingerprint API should be resilient against. For example, although there is no official reference, we argue that the fingerprint API is designed to protect from attackers that can completely compromise the untrusted OS. After introducing several relevant threat models, we identify common API usage patterns and show how inappropriate choices can make apps vulnerable to multiple attacks. We then design and implement a new static analysis tool to automatically analyze the usage of the fingerprint API in Android apps. Using this tool, we perform the first systematic study on how the fingerprint API is used. The results are worrisome: Our tool indicates that 53.69% of the analyzed apps do not use any cryptographic check to ensure that the user actually touched the fingerprint sensor. Depending on the specific use case scenario of a given app, it is not always possible to make use of cryptographic checks. However, a manual investigation on a subset of these apps revealed that 80% of them could have done so, preventing multiple attacks. Furthermore, the tool indicates that only the 1.80% of the analyzed apps use this API in the most secure way possible, while many others, including extremely popular apps such as Google Play Store and Square Cash, use it in weaker ways. To make things worse, we find issues and inconsistencies even in the samples provided by the official Google documentation. We end this work by suggesting various improvements to the fingerprint API to prevent some of these problematic attacks. © 2018 25th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2018.

Data are from a 2012 representative survey on consumer payment choice in the United States. Using discrete-choice random utility models to simulate consumer behavior, the estimation provides two major findings. First, mobile payment does not replace physical payment cards, but is likely to substitute for paper-based payment methods such as cash and checks at the adoption stage. Second, mobile payment does not statistically significantly influence the choice of payment means at the POS in terms of usage. However, there is suggestive evidence that it is complementary to card payments and a substitute for paper-based payment instruments. The findings highlight the potential social welfare gains of mobile payment and provide key insights into challenging issues for the private industry sector. This paper furthermore offers novel evidence on the impact of mobile payment on the use and adoption of existing payment instruments and contributes to the literature on consumer payment choice. © 2016, The Author(s).},

A CVR is a put option committing to pay additional cash or securities to CVR holders, contingent on the issuer's share price falling below a prespecified reference level. In this paper, we develop a model to show that CVRs can help a higher-intrinsic-value firm to reveal its firm type when the firm faces an asymmetric information problem. Our model predicts that i) when CVRs are offered along with cash or stock, the announcement period abnormal stock return is greater than that in stock offers, ii) firms facing more severe asymmetric information problems are more likely to offer CVRs to signal their firm type, and iii) firms that are relatively more cash-constrained are more likely to offer CVRs rather than cash. We test all three predictions using a sample of mergers and acquisitions. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the model. © 2008, Michael G. Foster School of Business.},

	abstract = {This research commentary proposes a 3-D implementation classification framework to assist service providers and business leaders in understanding the kinds of contexts in which more or less successful cashless payment solutions are observed at point-of-sale (PoS) settings. Three constructs characterize the framework: the digitalization of the local implementation environment; the relative novelty of a given payment technology solution in a country at a specific point in time; and the development status of the national infrastructure. The framework is motivated by a need to support cross-country research in this domain. We analyze eight country mini-cases based on an eight-facet (2 × 2 × 2) classification. A key insight is the distinction between local and national environments for solution implementations, and that there are no objective “low-tech” or “high-tech” payment solutions, but only those that must be calibrated by a country's experience at the national or local implementation environment levels. Our analysis also revealed that implementing cashless payment solutions is complex, with each country and local context having its own set of challenges. Our proposed framework is a basis for policy-makers and payment service providers to developing insights related to the challenges of cashless payment solution implementation. Developing countries sometimes are able to leapfrog their legacy infrastructures by using mobile payment solutions, while developed countries need to appreciate the importance of barriers to implementation success, such as costs, settlement delays, and the habitual use of cash. We further note why business leaders should consider their approaches to payment solutions in view of the different degrees of local digitalization and national infrastructure development to support tech innovations in the digital economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Prior research suggests that this decreases the psychological sense of loss or ‘pain’ that consumers feel when making a purchase with more direct payment types (such as cash) and leads them to spend more money. To help address this issue, the present research explores, designs, and tests haptic vibration feedback configurations aimed at restoring the ‘pain’ of paying with cashless payment options (i.e., online and mobile payment). Counter-intuitively, the present research finds that lower- (vs. higher-) intensity vibration feedback reduces participants’ reported willingness-to-spend when compared to a control group that does not receive any vibration feedback. This work is one of the first to explore the role of haptic vibration feedback in nudging consumers to reduce their spending when using cashless payment methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

A practical and flexible electronic payment system is one of the key success factors in electronic commerce. Most of the pre-paid anonymous e-cash schemes do not provide lost money recovery. Also, the communication and computation cost of most existing anonymous payment schemes is still high. In this paper, we propose RO-cash, a practical and flexible recoverable pre-paid offline e-cash scheme using bilinear pairing. In RO-cash, we use bilinear pairings in elliptic curves to reduce the computation and communication cost. By distributing the power of a single bank authority to the bank manager and the auditor, the untraceability can be preserved even if the bank manager is not honest in lost-coin recovery. Since our proposed scheme is an offline scheme, it is suitable for the real world environment in which the network connection between a shop and the bank server may not be available during the payment phase. Also, since our proposed scheme is a general scheme, other e-cash schemes with nice properties, e.g. D-cash, PayWord, AOMPS, ownership-claimable e-cash, scheduled e-cash, etc., can be directly applied to our scheme without changing the underlying system structure. This will make our scheme more flexible for attracting customers to use different value-added services. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Germans are still very fond of using cash. Of all direct payments transactions in 2008, cash accounted for an astounding 82 % in terms of number and for 58 % in terms of value. With a dataset that combines transaction information with survey data on payment behaviour of German consumers, we shed light on how individuals decide on their cash usage. We employ a two-stage empirical framework which jointly explains payment card ownership and the use of cash. Our results indicate that cash usage is compatible with systematic economic decision making. Consumers decide on the adoption of payment cards and then use available payment media according to transaction characteristics, the relative costs of cash and card usage, socio-demographic characteristics and their assessment of payment instruments' characteristics. Importantly, older consumers use significantly more cash than younger consumers. We show that this difference in payment behaviour is not attributable to age as such but largely to differences in the characteristics of older and younger consumers. This suggests that the high cash intensity of older consumers cannot fully be attributed to the role of habit or to their slow adoption to new payment technologies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {In the hustle and bustle of modern life, everyone wants to enhance and advance their working and personal life and mobile phones have become the favoured technology to achieve that aim. In light of this trend, most financial service providers have taken steps to meet this new lifestyle demand by developing mobile applications so that people can manage their financial matters on the go. This movement has also motivated many merchants around the world to adopt mobile technology as part of their aspiration to provide a better experience for their customers. This study explores the factors influencing Malaysian merchants' acceptance of mobile payment as an additional payment method to the traditionally accepted payment methods of cash and credit/debit cards. The aim of this study is to figure out the factors affecting merchants' decision to use mobile payments to help the provider companies shape their own marketing plans and consider the weak points that may turn the merchants against this marktet. This empirical study uses a survey method and AMOS to test and analyse the perceptions of a sample of 125 food and beverage providers located in food courts in 10 shopping malls at the Klang Valley in Malaysia. The study found that perceived usefulness has a significant positive impact on mobile payment acceptance, while the perceived ease of use has no significant impact on the merchants' decision to offer this payment method, which is not compatible with the technology acceptance model (TAM). In addition, this study added a further two factors to the TAM to investigate their effects on merchants' acceptance of mobile payments and found a significant positive effect for compatibility with customers' needs but no significant effect for perceived risk, which can be justified by the nature of this industry. This study, therefore, provides invaluable insights into the factors affecting merchants' acceptance of mobile payments, especially food and beverages providers in food courts located in shopping malls of Malaysia. © 2020, Social Sciences Research Society.},

The customer can modify the date slip but it does not become effective until the merchant passes it on to the bank. Also, the usage of this proposed scheme is very flexible, unlike most e-cash schemes that embed an expiration date when e-cash is withdrawn. This scheme still possesses the untraceability property and the computation complexity for customers and merchants is simple when compared to bank operations.},

To date, worldwide the use of NFC MPS is still a niche application but, at the same time, it is growing quickly. Research exploring how NFC MPS users differ from non-users is scarce and mostly limited to future behavioral intentions instead of actual use behaviors. Therefore, the present study explores how 677 real NFC MPS users of the German business unit of a large mobile network operator differ from 677 non-users in terms of socio-demographic and mobile-device characteristics, mobile communication behaviors and the availability of merchants with NFC terminals in the neighborhood of their place of residence. NFC MPS users were likely to be male and older subscribers who were equipped with a larger-screen smartphone, generated higher mobile Internet traffic, held a music streaming service subscription, paid lower monthly bills for mobile communication services and lived in a residential area with a higher number of merchant NFC terminals. Furthermore, we shed light on how use predictors are related to the timing of subscribers’ NFC MPS use starts. Early users tended to be equipped with a highly-priced smartphone whose display screen was nevertheless smaller, used a music streaming service and generated lower monthly communication service bills. Implications for practitioners and scholars are drawn from the results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

It focuses on the traditional versions of the monetary mechanism—the mechanism through which the monetary authority endeavors to control nominal income. In these versions, the monetary aggregate controlled by the central bank is money as traditionally defined to consist of all the means of payment and the control is assumed to be complete. It examines the nature and stability of the income velocity of the narrow measure of money implied by four basic macroeconomic models: (1) the classical model of the quantity theory of money, (2) a model combining the classical assumptions of perfect price flexibility, (3) the Keynesian model of liquidity preference, and (4) a general macroeconomic model. All models have been expressed in comparable specifications and incorporate additive stochastic terms. The chapter discusses the process of creation of money; money is neither created directly nor rigidly controlled by the central bank. A general issue of the feasibility and desirability of endeavoring to control nominal income through financial aggregates other than the money supply as conventionally defined is also discussed. © 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

	abstract = {Today more and more enterprises and individuals are outsourcing their data to cloud storage system. Data deduplication is one of the important technologies to reduce the storage cost of cloud storage system. In a cloud storage system with deduplication technology, the client can outsource the data files to the cloud storage server and pay for them. Fair payment is one of key issues in the cloud deduplication storage system. At present, a variety of secure deduplication encryption schemes have been designed to protect the privacy of client data. However, most existing fair payment solutions use traditional electronic cash systems to generate payment tokens, which requires a trusted authority to prevent double-spending. Trusted authorities will become bottlenecks in the payment system. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new decentralized fair payment protocol for cloud deduplication storage system by utilizing ethereum blockchain technology. The new protocol takes advantage of the decentralization of blockchain technology, allowing direct transactions without the participation of trusted third parties. In the new protocol, if a malicious situation occurs, the system can guarantee fair payment by pre-storing penalty money in the smart contract. Safety analysis and experimental analysis show that our new protocol is feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore a theoretical model using the push-pull-mooring framework which adopts both direct and moderating effects, in relation to building antecedents of Muslim switching intention (SI) from using cash to mobile payment (m-payment). Design/methodology/approach: The data collected were 317 respondents, then processed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach (SEM-PLS). Furthermore, advanced PLS techniques such as PLS predict, blindfolding and importance-performance map analysis are used to verify the statistical analysis of findings. Findings: This research underlines the importance of religious commitment factor when talking about Muslims SI to use m-payment. Moreover, the features of m-payment, such as enjoyment, efficiency, security and convenience, have contributed to the driving and attracting factors for Muslim individuals to switch from cash to m-payment. Practical implications: Fundamentally it is highly recommended that the highest concentration of service provider strategies is always obeying the principles of Islamic finance, with regard to the Muslim community as their target market. Specific to the government, the distribution of supporting infrastructure and literacy of new technologies such as m-payment are still important points in an effort to create a cashless society. Originality/value: The model in this study emphasizes the internal and external construction of a Muslim in relation to the behavior of SI from using cash to m-payment. Thus, the construction of the model that has been built is considered to bring more relevant factors to explain the m-payment adoption behavior of a Muslim from various perspectives. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Prescription painkiller abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the United States. In the past year, approximately one out of twenty Americans reported misuse or abuse of prescription painkillers. Several factors contribute to the prescription painkiller epidemic. Drug abusers use various methods-such as doctor shopping, paying with cash, and filling prescriptions in different states-to avoid detection and obtain prescription painkillers for illegitimate uses. A few rogue physicians and pharmacists, lured by substantial profits, enable drug abusers by illegally prescribing or supplying controlled substances. Even ethical physicians rarely have adequate training to recognize and address prescription drug abuse, and as a result, prescribe painkillers to patients who are not using them for legitimate medical purposes. Similarly, although the majority of pharmacies have taken steps to combat drug abuse and reduce prescription painkiller dispensing, under current reporting systems, pharmacists lack visibility into several important indicators of drug abuse. As a result, even the most vigilant pharmacists find it extremely difficult to identify and detect drug abuse with certainty. While state governments have established prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to crack down on prescription drug abuse, these programs have proven to be inadequate. The programs currently suffer from inadequate data collection, ineffective utilization of data, insufficient interstate data sharing, and constraints on sharing data with law enforcement and state agencies. By contrast, third-party prescription payment systems run by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) or health insurers have been effective in detecting prescription drug abuse. This paper suggests that a national prescription drug reporting program building on existing PBM networks could be significantly more effective than existing state PDMPs in detecting prescription drug abuse.},

	abstract = {Research in this article traces the origins of a process of competitive change in British retail financial markets by looking at the emergence of cash dispensers technology, how it transformed into automated teller machines (ATMs) and how proprietary ATM networks gave way to total interoperability of cash withdrawals through a single common switch. Cash dispensers were an industry-specific innovation developed by British manufacturers (e.g. Chubb and De La Rue) which were, in turn, overtaken by US (e.g. NCR) and German (e.g. Siemens-Wincor) manufacturers. However, as the ATM became a global technology some of the leading providers (i.e. Burroughs, IBM and NCR) kept manufacturing and even their main design facilities in Scotland. The evolution of this technology illustrates changing boundaries of the banking organisation, the challenges faced by financial intermediaries to adopt on-line, real-time computing and highlights the role of network externalities in financial markets. From a business history perspective, the ATM, electronic funds transfer and other retail payment media have largely been neglected by British historians and management scholars. Yet the success of automated cash dispensers as a distribution channel in retail banking epitomises a shift in bank strategy, namely how applications of computer technology moved from being potential sources of competitive advantage to being a minimum requirement for effective competition in retail finance. This article thus promotes the idea that the history of technology must consider its users, their strategies and business models inasmuch as business histories of the late twentieth century will be incomplete without attention to developments in information and communications technologies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study is twofold: first, to investigate the determinants of customers' switching intention from traditional payments to proximity mobile payments (PMPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic for specific insight on how these factors shape customers' switching intentions; second, this study discusses the relationship between traditional payments and PMP services. Design/methodology/approach: The study data were collected from individual customers who used both traditional payments and PMP in a physical store during the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the validity of the variables and the causal relationships among variables based on 305 valid data. Findings: The results show that the factor of traditional payments, that is, dissatisfaction positively and significantly influenced customers' switching intention. Factors of PMP, namely perceived usefulness (PUF) and perceived ease of use (EOU), positively and significantly impacted switching intention. In addition, the relationship between traditional payments and PMP, that is, low perceived substitutability was found to negatively influence switching intention, PUF and EOU. Research limitations/implications: First, the study targets are customers with experience in using PMP after the COVID-19 pandemic. It is suggested to compare customers who had experience using PMP before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, although cash and bank cards belong to the category of traditional payments, they have different degrees of contact when transactions occur. The contact rate of bank cards is lower than that of cash. This study did not differentiate between cash and bank cards, which is the main limitation. Originality/value: First, this study provides a reference to examine mobile payment usage from the perspective of both incumbent and alternative services conjointly under emergency situations, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the application of migration theory to the context of mobile payment extends existing research on mobile payment. Third, this study is among the first to investigate the relationship between traditional payments and PMP. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

By adapting the theoretical framework of Dutkowsky and VanHoose (2018b, 2020) to the euro area, this study investigates and clarifies the conditions under which a digital euro could be introduced on a large scale without leading to bank disintermediation or a credit crunch. First, the central bank would require proper mechanisms to manage the volume and the user cost of CBDC in circulation. Second, the central bank should continue to facilitate access to its long-term lending facilities, to provide banks with a funding source alternative to client deposits at an equivalent cost. Depending on its design, a digital euro could improve bank profitability and competitiveness by absorbing large amounts of idle (and expensive) excess reserves without penalizing lending, while incentivizing bank digitalization. © 2022},

The research finds that e-CNY will have significant impact on monetary policy: (1) E-CNY will change the structure of money demand, speed up currency circulation, make central bank reserves more controllable and money supply more intelligent; (2) E-CNY will increase the volatility and expansion effect of currency multiplier to a certain extent; (3) E-CNY will dredge the transmission channel of monetary policy so as to improve the transmission effect of existing monetary policy tools. At the same time, based on the organic combination with structural monetary policy tools, it will achieve precise implementation of medium-term lending facilities (MLF), pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and it may bring new monetary policy tools. (4) E-CNY will make the intermediate target of monetary policy more controllable and reliable, and have a positive impact on the target of monetary policy through the smooth transmission of monetary policy channels. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on CBDC, give full play to the positive role of e-CNY in monetary policy, and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper explores the precarious balance between modernizing monetary systems by means of digital currencies (either issued by the central bank itself or independently) and safeguarding financial stability as also ensured by tangible payment (and saving) instruments like paper money. Design/methodology/approach: Which aspects of modern payment systems could contribute to improve the way of functioning of today's globalized economy? And, which might even threaten the above-mentioned instable equilibrium? This survey paper aims, precisely, at giving some preliminary answers to a complex – therefore, ongoing – debate at scientific as well as banking and political levels. Findings: The coexistence of State's money (i.e. “legal tender”) and cryptocurrencies can have a disciplining effect on central banks. Nevertheless, there are still high risks connected to the introduction of central bank digital currency, which should be by far not considered to be a perfect substitute of current cash. At the same time, cryptocurrencies issued by central banks might be exposed to the drawbacks of cryptocurrencies without benefiting from correspondingly strong advantages. A well-governed two-tier system to be achieved through innovation in payment infrastructures might be, in turn, more preferable. Regulated competition by new players combined with “traditional” deposits and central bank elements remains essential, although central banks should embrace the technologies underlying cryptocurrencies, because risk payment service providers could move to other currency areas considered to be more appealing for buyers and sellers. Research limitations/implications: We do not see specific limitations besides the fact that the following is for sure a broad field of scientific research to be covered, which is at the same time at the origin of ongoing developments and findings. Originality and implications of the paper are, instead, not only represented by its conclusions (which highlight the role of traditional payment instruments and stress why the concept of “money” still has to have specific features) but also by its approach of recent literature's review combined with equally strong logical-analytical insights. Practical implications: In the light of these considerations, even the role of traditional payment systems like paper money is by far not outdated or cannot be – at this point, at least – replaced by central bank digital currencies (whose features based on dematerialization despite being issued and guaranteed by a public authority are very different). Social implications: No matter which form it might assume is what differentiates economic from barter transactions. This conclusion is by far not tautological or self-evident since the notion of money has historically been a great object of scientific discussion. In the light of increasingly modern payment instruments, there is no question that money and the effectiveness of related monetary policies have to be also explored from a social perspective according to different monetary scenarios, ranging from central bank digital currencies to private currencies and cash restrictions/abolition. Originality/value: The originality/value of the following article is represented by the fact that it (1) refers to some of the most relevant and recent contributions to this research field, (2) moves from payment systems in general to their newest trends like cryptocurrencies, cash restrictions (or, even, abolition proposals) and monetary policy while (3) combining all elements to reach a common picture. The paper aims at being a comprehensive contribution dealing with "money" in its broadest but also newest sense. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the antecedents of cashless payment systems among businesses in Malaysia. The adoption of cashless payment systems by businesses has the potential to reduce the costs related to handling huge amounts of cash in the market and enhance transaction speed. Unfortunately, its current adoption in Malaysia is still small and very little is known about the factors. A seven-factor model based on the TOE framework was developed and tested. The partial least square (PLS) statistical approach was employed to analyze data collected from 200 business entities in Malaysia. The results reveal that compatibility and technology competence have higher significant relationships with the adoption of cashless payment systems. Management support, firm critical mass, competitive pressure, and information intensity are significantly related to the adoption of cashless payment systems, while firm size is not associated with it. The findings of this study provide significant practical implications for Malaysian stakeholders and technology vendors to recognize factors that affect a firm’s adoption of cashless payment systems to support business transactions. By investigating the phenomenon through the TOE framework, this study presents an integrated model of cashless payment systems by businesses. Our findings also offer guidance for future application of the PLS method in cashless payment and related research. The paper provides a more holistic understanding of the factors influencing cashless payment systems among businesses. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Despite a growing trend in m-wallet services in Malaysia, the actual level of usage is considered low among all of the non-cash payment methods. The Malaysian government has taken a serious initiative in spurring the use of m-wallets by providing a one-off RM30 incentive to all eligible Malaysians. As such, it is important to understand the motivations behind m-wallet usage by examining Alipay, which is favoured in the international, as well as Malaysian markets. This research investigates the effects of mobile payment knowledge, personal innovativeness, self-efficacy, convenience, and compatibility on the actual adoption of Alipay in Malaysia with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, as the mediators. Using importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) and Variance Accounted For (VAF), based on Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) on 260 respondents, it was discovered that compatibility and perceived usefulness demonstrated high importance in improving the performance of Alipay adoption. The results also showed a direct effect between compatibility and mobile payment knowledge. Additionally, perceived usefulness was shown to be an essential mediator in influencing the impact of compatibility and convenience on the actual adoption of Alipay. This study has produced essential policy recommendations for both mobile wallet providers and policymakers on how to further promote the adoption of mobile wallets in Malaysia. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {Near Field Communication (NFC) is a promising digital payment technology that is expected to substitute cash. However, despite its potential, NFC-based payment has not reached mass adoption on the customer nor on the merchant side. This paper constructs a preliminary framework for studying digital payment systems and analyzing strategies of current market actors, such as banks, mobile network operators, and merchants. These market actors are identified as incumbents or contenders, and they are currently jockeying for digital payment platform leadership. We analyze three different contactless payment systems implemented or planned by different actors in the European market. When synthesizing our observations, we note that all three multi-sided platforms (MSP) can provide fully functional and technically solid NFC payment systems. All three platforms seek to gain a foothold by subsidizing NFC payment instruments to their existing customer base. In addition, they extend their existing platform with other contactless services, thereby transforming existing cards (SIM or debit) from single-purpose to multi-functional cards. Our research extends existing payment literature from the MSP perspective to accommodate technological developments, where technology (NFC) and platform design impact market actor strategies and complementary products.},

	abstract = {The Social Security Scheme was launched in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related sickness, maternity and invalidity including cash benefits and funeral grants. The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1.5% of payroll (total of 4.5%). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a flat rate capitation basis to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim of this paper is to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves and expenditures on sickness benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.},

	abstract = {Mobile wallets (m-wallet) have played a prominent role in changing our system of payment from cash to digital payment. The current study employs a systematic review of articles published on m-wallets between January 2008 and January 2020. To identify the relevant studies, research databases are searched using different keywords. Research articles published on m-wallets are selected based on particular inclusion criteria and clustered on the basis of keywords, abstract and title. To ensure a reasonable accuracy in the selection and grouping of published literature, suggestions of experts are taken into consideration. The articles on m-wallets are categorized on the basis of their themes. Eight dominant themes are identified by the authors. The findings suggest that although m-wallets have been in existence for more than a decade, there is hardly any study related to m-wallet service quality measurement. Thus, the authors propose 10 dimensions to measure the service quality of m-wallets based on the extensive review of studies on electronic services (e-services) and m-wallets. The proposed dimensions of m-wallet service quality are prioritized using the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. The m-wallet service quality dimensions proposed in the article will help practitioners to develop strategies for building a customer base. Moreover, the results of the fuzzy TOPSIS technique employed in this study will apprise managers about critical quality factors that need sincere attention for gaining competitive advantage and retaining customers. © 2020 IMI.},

Against this backdrop, this paper provides a techno-legal taxonomy of approaches to balance privacy and transparency in CBDCs without thwarting accountability, but it also underlines cross-sectoral impacts. The contribution heeds regulation-by-design as its core methodological foundation, with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies as the relevant use case. Thus, it highlights that not only technology aids legal purposes, but also that some regulatory requirements ought to be designed into technology for one to reach agreed-upon results and/or standards.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Considering the growing prominence of the Fintech-led-Mobile-Payment (FMP) platform, it has become imperative for practitioners and academicians to look beyond technology adoption to understand causal relationships. Building on the premise, previous literature primarily examined the causal relationships to describe the phenomenon of evolving digital payment technology in a varied context. However, limited studies explored user classification and profiling with some exceptions, principally stressing upon barely online and mobile-based banking segmentation contexts. Grounded in analyzing user taxonomy based on benefits-trust-behavioral linkage model from the purview of an emerging mobile-based digital payment market, this research aims to identify and test an a-priori approach to market segmentation of FMP platform users and profiling them based on perceived benefits, behavioral, and socio-demographic characterization. To analyze the model of users' classification, 550 valid online responses were received and employed a blended analytical approach of multivariate techniques (CFA, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis) along with the bivariate technique of the Chi-square test for clustering procedures followed by resulting clusters' validation and their profiling. The three distinct segments are identified as ‘The Fintech Dubious,’ ‘The Cash Conservatives, ‘and ‘The Fintech Enthusiasts.’ The study also advances the current theoretical understanding of the trust based modified version of UTAUT with the associative framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude, and intention’ by adding two additional cognitive constructs of perceived trust and perceived price value along with added socio-demographics (usage frequency and geographical area). Lastly, this timely study offers several unflinching implications for the practitioners of strategic marketing and policymakers for encouraging FMP usage. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Technological disruption and social transformation are shaping and explain the radical changes introduced in financial services. A new technological mix of mobile-apps, big data, blockchain, AI, cloud computing and digital platforms is taking place with unprecedented speed and is forcing traditional banks to consider this technology to form part of new collaborative value creation networks, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). Traditional payment habits based on cash and credit or debit cards are being replaced by new innovative formats of mobile instant payment among end users (P2P). Through a single case study – Bizum's DBE – the purpose of this research is to explore how successful was the defensive strategy developed by traditional banking entities with the objective to lead the new mobile instant payment ecosystem in Spain. The findings show that Bizum's DBE is helping traditional banking entities to create a superior digital value that is being adopted very quickly by a huge number of users in Spain. The main contribution of this study is the complete explanation of how a winning strategy of creation and development of a DBE can: i) ensure survival of incumbents in the face of threats from digital disruptive actors, and ii) transform consumer habits very quickly, due to the superior created value as a new solution for that need. We used the novel reformulation of the Modularity Theory (Baldwin, 2020c) which can be considered as a first step for a DBE-specific theorisation and supportive framework to understand the deep social impact of the different network effects generated. © 2021},

Yet despite a deep transformation and diversification of their payment eco-systems and the formalization of plans to become “cashless economies” modelled on South Korea and Sweden, cash continues to dominate payments in both countries. While industry players typically attribute the prevalence of cash in the region to questions of infrastructure readiness, transaction costs, and cyber-security, this paper finds that plans to expand digital payments at the expense of cash may not be well-adapted to countries with high levels of socio-economic inequality. It proposes a link between socio-economic inequality and use of cash in emerging economies, and concludes that it may be better to not view the relationship between cash and digital payments in binary zero-sum terms, until there is a better understanding of the socio-economic, technological, and policy context in which countries like South Korea and Sweden have managed to reduce their reliance on cash in favor of a diversified digital payments eco-system. © 2020 by the author.},

The information system, funded by USAID and implemented by Emerging Markets Group from 1999 to 2004, has revolutionised accounting practices and has contributed to a more transparent and effective public sector. This article describes the project's context and purpose, its main features, challenges and obstacles. It continues by outlining the critical success factors that have contributed to the success of the project in a challenging environment. The project was implemented in a rather unique environment since it was initiated not long after the end of the civil war and the creation of the Republic of BiH. The Republic of BiH inherited the former socialist Yugoslavian payment systems. There were no adequate public financial management systems in place, and the project team could essentially start from scratch. The project team designed and implemented an accrual accounting system, and unlike the situation in many countries, relieved the government from having to transform their financial management system from cash-based accounting to accrual accounting.

	abstract = {Credit cards have often been blamed for consumer overspending and for the growth in household debt. Indeed, laboratory studies of purchase behavior have shown that credit cards can facilitate spending in ways that are difficult to justify on purely financial grounds. However, the psychological mechanisms behind this spending facilitation effect remain conjectural. A leading hypothesis is that credit cards reduce the pain of payment and so ‘release the brakes’ that hold expenditures in check. Alternatively, credit cards could provide a ‘step on the gas,’ increasing motivation to spend. Here we present the first evidence of differences in brain activation in the presence of real credit and cash purchase opportunities. In an fMRI shopping task, participants purchased items tailored to their interests, either by using a personal credit card or their own cash. Credit card purchases were associated with strong activation in the striatum, which coincided with onset of the credit card cue and was not related to product price. In contrast, reward network activation weakly predicted cash purchases, and only among relatively cheaper items. The presence of reward network activation differences highlights the potential neural impact of novel payment instruments in stimulating spending—these fundamental reward mechanisms could be exploited by new payment methods as we transition to a purely cashless society. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {We are entering a new monetary era. Central banks around the world-spurred by the development of privately controlled digital currencies as well as competition from other central banks-have been studying, building, and, in some cases, issuing central bank digital currency (“CBDC”). Although digital fiat currency is one of the hottest topics in macroeconomics and central banking today, the discussion has largely overlooked the most straightforward and appealing strategy for implementing a U.S. dollar-based CBDC: expanding access to bank accounts that the Federal Reserve already offers to a small, favored set of clients. These accounts consist of entries in a digital ledger-like other digital currencies-and are extremely desirable, offering high interest, instant payments, and full government backing with no limit. But U.S. law restricts these accounts to an exclusive clientele consisting primarily of banks. Privileged access to these accounts creates a striking asymmetry at the core of our monetary framework: government-issued physical currency is available to all, but government-issued digital currency (in the form of central bank accounts) is not. This dichotomy is unwarranted. Congress should authorize the Federal Reserve to give everyone-individuals, businesses, and institutions-the option to maintain accounts at the central bank. We call these accounts FedAccounts. Unlike the CBDC approaches currently under discussion, which would use complicated and inefficient distributed ledger technology and be walled off from the existing system of money and payments, FedAccounts would be seamlessly interoperable with the mainstream payment system, relying on technologies that the Federal Reserve has used for decades. © 2021 George Washington University.

	abstract = {The pre-eminence of the bank branch as an effective delivery system arose from the difficulties associated with marketing financial services. The branch provides a highly efficient mechanism for administering, collecting and delivering cash as well as a wide range of lending and ancillary services. Historically, branch networks arose to attract cheap retail deposits through the convenience of the branch location itself and through branch-based payment systems. Indeed, the relationship between the customer and the branch underpins the whole banking process. However, the branch's exclusive function is tenable only so long as the assumptions and conditions that determined its historical position hold good. These assumptions are that the market will continue to respond to it, that it will remain the basis for patterns of competitive behaviour and that more effective and economic delivery systems will not emerge. This article presents the view that these assumptions are in fact being undermined, particularly by innovations in technology, which will necessitate a complete rethink of future strategy in retail branch banking. In recent years attempts have been made to promote superstores as district centres or focused centres'. This article reviews ideas about the retail hierarchy and shopping centres developed in British planning and, from a recent survey of Exeter, examines differences between the use of superstores and district centres and the utilisation of non-retail facilities. It seems clear that superstore developments fall well outside the traditional concepts of district centres, and their role needs careful examination. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In the empirical literature, these two variables are often considered independently, although they may have an endogenous relationship in a contractual setting. Using a sample of European M&As over the 2000-2010 decade, we show that these two variables are jointly set in a contractual empirical approach. The relationship between the percentage of cash and the offer premium is positive: higher premiums yield payments with more cash. We highlight that the payment choice is not a continuum between full cash and full share payments. Two different regimes of payment in M&A transactions are empirically characterized. We analyze the major determinants of M&A terms when the offer premium and the means of payment are jointly set. The underlying rationale of an asymmetry of information and a risk-sharing calculus is found to be significant in the setting of the agreement. © 2013.},

We analyze this question using a unique diary survey in which both participants with a Dutch and a foreign background documented their daily purchases.

For instance, we find that first-generation migrants from a number of countries that can be seen as cash-oriented are more likely to use cash in the Netherlands. At the same time, second-generation migrants have similar payment habits as individuals with a Dutch background. This finding suggests that payment behavior is not passed on between generations, but affected by host country payment habits. Finally, we suggest that, in this context, special information campaigns to increase debit card usage will not have clear net social benefits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The uniqueness of Paris as a market rested on the strong influence of the court. Craftsmen and shopkeepers knowingly exploited the rule of distinction borne by their clients and invented novelties and launched fashions capable of enticing them. Their advertising thus focused on a multi-faceted notion of quality: quality as it related to the shopkeeper, to the consumer, to the shop and to the products. Always on the lookout for novelty, aristocrats were the great suppliers of quality goods. Invariably short of cash, they used such goods as a means of payment to tradesmen, who stood at the centre of a triple market, made up of new and second-hand goods and those sold on credit. High quality and imitation, new and old: shopkeepers used a wide qualitative vocabulary to attract customers. This is how the semi-luxury market developed also among the less affluent. Thus, apparently archaic practices such as barter were in fact used to promote a new market, a semi-luxury market, and are essential to understanding the eighteenth-century consumer explosion. advertising - consumer products - consumption - economy - eighteenth-century - Paris - shopkeepers.},

Users are able to send money to each other conveniently from their M-PESA using only their mobile phones. A key to the success of M-PESA is the availability of an extensive network of retail shops that accept M-PESA deposits and withdrawals, i.e. they stand ready to exchange cash and electronic value. It is the stores that provide liquidity to the system, and they are paid a commission by M-PESA for this service. Behind the store is a network of intermediaries that arrange the logistics around cash management. In this paper we look at daily transactional data from six M-PESA stores in Western Kenya supplemented by case studies and interviews of MPESA store managers and employees in order to better understand the liquidity management needs of these stores. We examine how liquidity needs vary by location and day of week/month, and by the level of service offered by the store. We find that stores require intense daily management of liquidity to maintain customer service levels and that this is more difficult in rural areas. We also find some evidence of market discipline for agents who can't maintain service levels.},

	abstract = {A dynamic cash-management model is analysed where agents choose whether to pay with cash or credit at every point in time. In the model credit usage depends on the current stock of cash, a novel result that matches recent micro evidence on households’ payment choices. The optimality of such a decision rule is novel and cannot be obtained by models where cash-credit decisions are made at the “beginning” of each period. We discuss how to use the model to account for cross country-evidence on the intensity of credit usage and for several statistics on the size and frequency of cash withdrawals. The model is used to assess the household's welfare cost of phasing out cash. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Last decade had been worst for humanity as it faced Covid-19. The pandemic invited many things unknown to humans such as lockdown, compulsory mask and no contact with other people or things. The 'No Contact' initiated much awaited progress in payment from being entity exchange to being digital. The digitization of payment became biggest transformation; every common citizen realized the use of digital payment. The evolution of cash payment to internet banking and internet banking to e-wallet has made transaction easier for all the services without exhibiting physical form. Payment Gateways, Digital Wallet, Internet Banking use has risen as being fast and instant. Though the recent payments are secure on theft front with the use of digital money by many users at many times online payment system might face problem on digital money transfer with issues such as wrong payment, link failure or single point failure. There might be more problems such as insider problem and transaction being transparent. For such situations more secure and private path towards security is needed as insufficiency will give rise to risk mitigation. The paper recommends a payment system which will be based on privacy and permission laid by blocks to blocks for use in financial sector. The architecture proposed integrates the digital wallet with different banks to give foundation of Blockchain for secure transactions. The peer to peer network will share transactions as well share load to minimize load on central banking system keep the load distributed and secure overall data centres.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Women are now paid separately from their husbands for their work on family oil palm plots thereby increasing the economic incentives for women to commit labor to oil palm production. The study incorporates broader local cultural and economic processes in the analysis of intra-household gender and labor relations to explain how the new payment systems successfully resolved intra-household disputes over labor and income. The paper highlights the critical role export firms can play in enhancing women's access to commodity crop income. Further, the paper demonstrates that by widening the framework of household analysis, insights can be gained into two key questions that have received only limited attention in the literature: the question of why men do not share a greater proportion of cash crop income with other family members; and, the apparent inability of families to resolve intra-household conflicts over income. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Given this limitation, the study draws on migration, regret, innovation resistance, status quo bias, and incentive theories to examine the switching intention from cash to m-payment based on a push-pull-mooring framework. A total of 250 usable sample sizes were adopted, with the conceptual model empirically validated using a PLS-SEM.

	abstract = {At present, several post-quantum cryptosystems have been proposed, and lattice-based cryptography is the main candidate. Especially in the direction of digital signatures, there are now many practical lattice-based signature schemes. However, there exist few lattice-based signatures with special property such as blind signature. Blind signature was introduced by Chaum for creating untraceable payment system. Then, it is widely used in e-cash and voting, especially in the revolutionary digital cash system based on blockchain. In our paper, we present a method to construct a post-quantum blind signature based on lattice assumptions, and we proved that any existential forger against the security of the resulting scheme can solve the SIS-q, n, m, β problem for β = \widetilde {O}(dn). Our main technique is the rejection sampling theory. The expected number of times needed to output a blind signature is at most 2 under aborting, and our new scheme has much smaller signature size than those of all the previously proposed blind signature schemes over lattices. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The B2c eCommerce is still far from realizing its full potential, despite its considerable growth in all the most important markets (USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy, etc.) in the last ten years. Several hurdles have to be overcome by both the customers and the merchants. One of the most cited is the lack of trust in the electronic payment. This is particularly so for the Italian market where customers have shown a strong reluctance in using the online shopping channel. The study presented in this paper seeks to understand if the payment systems can be considered as a barrier for the B2c eCommerce diffusion. More in detail the objectives of the paper are two-fold: • to give a detailed picture of the payment systems used to shop online and of the main related issues both from the merchant and the consumer side; • to build an explanatory theory to justify the current and future diffusion of the various payment systems that takes into account the factors influencing their suitability for the B2c eCommerce. The analysis is mainly based on case studies among the most important (top100) Italian eCommerce merchants which have been carried out as part of the B2c Observatory of the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano. The latter has studied the online sales in Italy since 2000 and has activated a research stream focused on the payment systems supporting the B2c eCommerce transactions. The 90% of the value of the B2c eCommerce transactions in 2008 in Italy has been supported by electronic Payments (credit cards,65%, eWallets,16%, and bank transfer,9%), but the trust building in the ePayment is low: 52% of the Italian Internet Users is afraid of using the credit card online. Despite the low trust, the security of the credit cards supporting the B2c eCommerce transactions is very high: the online frauds in Italy represent about 0,2% of the value of the online transactions in 2008 and, moreover, most of the frauds take place offline. Fraud prevention systems are widely adopted among the top 100 eCommerce websites: 4 out of 5 adopt at least one of them. The main driver affecting the diffusion of the different payment systems is their suitability to the online channel and not the trust of the users. We clustered the main payment systems according to all the main factors affecting their suitability to support the B2c eCommerce transactions. The most appropriate systems for the B2c eCommerce (we called them "eCommerce Best fitting"-credit cards and eWallets), are also the most diffused ones. They are followed by the bank transfer (defined as an "eCommerce Appropriate" system) and by all the other systems (loan, cash on delivery, postal order) that have been called "eCommerce only if necessary". Trust does not seem to be the critical factor driving the diffusion of the payment systems. The correlation of the diffusion with trust is negligible with respect to the one with suitability. Despite their high trust, cash on delivery and postal orders are not very diffused, while the credit cards, despite their low trust, are the most diffused payment system. © Riccardo Mangiaracina and Alessandro Perego, 2009.},

However, successful launching of the electronic purse depends mainly on consumers' acceptance, which in the past was very low in Austria. We study consumers' acceptance of the electronic purse, cash and established non-cash payment systems by analysing social representations of payment facilities. Semantic contents of associations raised in response to the stimulus words "means of payment in general", "cash", "cheque", "ATM-card", "credit-card" and "electronic purse" have been analysed. Overall, 264 people were studied applying two techniques: the "associative network" and the "conceptual network". It is shown that means of payment are categorised on two dimensions: cash and non-cash. Non-cash payment facilities are characterised by high abstraction levels, and loss of subjective control over expenditures. The electronic purse is perceived as highly dissimilar to other means of payments. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper describes how the profits of banking malware are generated and subsequently laundered, with a particular focus on the use of bitcoins and other digital payment methods. Computers are infected with banking malware via phishing emails, in which people are persuaded in various ways to click on links or open attachments, or via exploit kits, programs that try to find weak spots in the security of computer systems. After infection, bank transfers of the online banking accounts of victims are manipulated via fake website screens (web injects). Behind the screens the amounts and beneficiaries of transactions are modified, emptying the victims’ bank accounts. In the next step, the banking malware profits are laundered. In this paper we describe two models that are used in particular (next to more traditional money laundering methods). The first model involves the use of money mules and a quick cash-out. The second model focuses on direct spending via (a) direct purchases of products via online shopping, (b) direct purchases of bitcoins via Bitcoin exchanges or (c) direct purchases of luxury goods. Bitcoins can be further laundered via so-called mixing services.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of factors that inhibit adoption of mobile payments service in India. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the extant literature on mobile payment service and other related literature, factors were identified that drive consumer resistance toward its adoption. It engaged “innovation resistance theory” framework for understanding consumer resistance. The framework addressed five categories of barriers, namely, usage, value, risk, image and tradition that lead to negative perception of innovation, and therefore, induces positive impact on its resistance. Additionally, the study considered a few lesser investigated barriers (habitual use of cash, surveillance, technology) for the study, thus extending the existing theoretical framework. Hypotheses were framed, field data were collected and then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Findings: Few interesting observations were made from the study. Usage, image and value barriers hindered adoption of mobile payment service. In case of men, usage, value and image were the primary barriers. For women, usage, image, habitual use of cash and technology acted as barriers that curbed mobile payments service adoption. Additionally, except risk, tradition and surveillance barriers, relationships of all other constructs with adoption intention were moderated by gender. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited to the views of the urban population in India who used mobile payments service. The results may vary across geographical contexts because of culture or socioeconomic differences. Practical implications: The growth of mobile payment service has remained sluggish in India despite high levels of digitization. The study results will offer valuable insights to the Indian business managers and policymakers to identify what action plan needs to be instituted to make mobile payments service more attractive and acceptable to users. Originality/value: This empirical study extended and tested the classical innovation resistance theory framework by adding three less studied barriers (surveillance, habitual use of cash and technology) in a developing nation, thus enriching the current literature on consumer resistance toward mobile payments. It also examined the moderating effect of gender on mobile payments service adoption. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We test whether consumer demand for payment instruments is price elastic, namely whether consumers are likely to deviate from their preferred methods in order to get a discount or to avoid a surcharge. We find that the occurrence of price incentives is low, but that given cash discounts, the probability that a cash transaction is conducted by a consumer who prefers other payment methods increased by 19.2 percent, after controlling for merchant category and dollar value of the transaction. Payment method choice is affected very strongly by consumer individual preferences, but steering by merchants may be effective under some circumstances. Both merchants’ reluctance to offer price discounts and consumers’ limited response to them lead to the low observed occurrences of such incentives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Electronic cash, and other cryptographic payment systems, offer a level of user anonymity during a purchase, in order to emulate electronically the properties of physical cash exchange. However, it has been noted that there are crime-prevention situations where anonymity of notes is undesirable; in addition there may be regulatory and legal constraints limiting anonymous transfer of funds. Thus pure anonymity of users may be, in certain settings, unacceptable and thus a hurdle to the progress of electronic commerce. The conceptual contribution of this work is based on the claim that given the legal, social, technical and efficiency constraints that are imposed, anonymity should be treated as a Control Parameter facilitating flexibility of the level of privacy of note holders (determined by the dynamic conditions and constraints). In light of this parameterization, we review recently developed technical tools for tracing and anonymity revocation (e.g., owner tracing and coin tracing). We elaborate on the differences in the various technologies with respect to security assumptions and we discuss practical considerations of computational, bandwidth and storage requirements for user, shop, bank and trustees as well as whether the trustees must be on-line or off-line. We also claim that while anonymity revocation can potentially reduce crime it can also produce instances where the severity of the crime is increased as criminals try to social engineer around tracing revocation. To prevent this we suggest the notion of “distress cash.” the technical side, we provide efficiency improvements to a protocol for coin tracing and point at a technical solution for distress cash. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Mobile-based payment is increasing exponentially but in the developing country like India, consumers’ perception is highly positive in daily cash transaction. The purpose of this research is to identify and examine the important challenges for mobile wallet (m-wallet) implementation in India. In the wake of COVID-19, one of the transmission mechanisms of this virus has been the coins and paper money passed between a buyer and a seller. As such m-wallet considered as a convenience of payment has become a necessity in light of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors explored 19 unique sets of challenges selected from the literature and collected data from 14 experts from private sector, multinational corporations and mixed private and public partnership who have significant knowledge and experience of mobile payment implementation and use in their respective organisations. Also, the authors have used Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology in developing a hierarchal model for the identified challenges. The authors implemented Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to classify the identified challenges. Findings: The ISM-based framework is divided into nine different hierarchical levels. “Lack of strong regulatory compliance (Ch6)” has been recognised as the most important challenge, which inhibited the mobile wallet implementation, whereas “Perception of customers about the value of using mobile wallets (Ch11)” is the most dependent critical challenge. There are seven hierarchical layers in between the top and the bottom level with the varied number of challenges based on their driving and dependence power. Originality/value: This is the first research to the best of our knowledge that has not only comprehensively reviewed the m-wallet literature but also employed a unique ISM-MICMAC-based approach to develop a framework of challenges for the m-wallet implementation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

While such systems can generate significant savings in the operation of monetary systems, payment services markets are typically uncompetitive and require regulatory and broader state interventions to ensure those savings are widely distributed. The use of those systems to broaden the reach of for-profit lenders raises a number of concerns, as a growing literature has documented how microcredit initiatives in developing countries have resulted primarily in expansions in consumption credit to households, often under predatory terms. The authors advance two original arguments in this connection. First, the perverse results of many microcredit initiatives reflect the underdevelopment of the areas concerned: without broader development strategies, potentially transformative productive projects are rare and unprofitable to finance. In contrast, widespread unmet consumption needs ensure consumption credit offers lenders a profitable alternative business orientation. Second, and in light of this, electronic payments platforms can contribute to economic development by enabling the establishment of well-regulated or public systems of electronic ‘narrow banks’ restricted from lending, but capable of widening access to affordable payments, savings and insurance services. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies},

Overall, the study finds that, following the intervention, a substitution effect emerged between saving portfolio choices, with the poor favouring bank accounts over informal saving arrangements. It also found that the Oportunidades savings account led to an increase in remittance reception, which in turn had important implications for household consumption smoothing and risk management decisions.

	abstract = {M-wallets are comparatively more advantageous and convenient than conventional payment systems as m-wallets allow users to avoid cash. The present research uses the diffusion of innovation theory as the base theory to propose a research model by incorporating constructs like convenience, perceived security, personal innovativeness, and perceived trust to investigate the determinants of consumers' intention-to-use m-wallets. A twofold approach comprising of Structural Equation Modelling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) was used: First, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to determine the significant determinants of intention-to-use. Second, the ANN approach was applied as robustness to corroborate the outcomes of PLS-SEM and to estimate the relative importance of the SEM-based significant determinants. Our findings confirmed that compatibility, ease of use, observability, convenience, relative advantage, personal innovativeness, perceived trust, and perceived security are the key elements that influence the intention-to-use m-wallets. Moreover, we ascertained that perceived security is the most influential predictor of intention-to-use. The outcomes of ANN have complemented the findings of PLS-SEM, but some differences were also exhibited in the order of influential factors. The study brings to fore significant insights and a set of suggestions for the companies carrying out the development, execution, and marketing of M-wallet services.

In recent years, the phenomenon of identity theft has gained widespread media coverage and has grown to be a major concern for payment providers and consumers alike. How identity theft has affected consumer’s payment choice is still an open research question. We use the 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC) to study the effect of identity theft incidents on adoption and usage patterns for nine different payment instruments in the U.S. Our results suggest that certain types of identity theft incidents affect positively the probability of adopting money orders, credit cards, stored value cards, bank account number payments and online banking bill payments. As for payment usage, we find that particular types of identity theft incidents have a positive and statistically significant effect on the use of cash, money orders and credit cards and a negative and statistically significant effect on the use of checks and online banking bill payments.

	abstract = {With the popularization of digital finance in China, mobile payments have penetrated into all aspects of residents' daily life. However, few studies have examined the potential impact of mobile payments on people's happiness in China. Using the nationally representative data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), this study adopts the ordered probit regression with endogenous treatment to adjust for possible endogeneity to assess the effect of mobile payments on residents' happiness. The results suggest an association between mobile payment usage and increases in happiness, which is supported by several robustness checks, such as using an alternative instrumental variable (IV), replacing the explained variable, and removing some extreme observations. In addition, we explore the mechanisms by which mobile payments affect residents' happiness from multiple perspectives. Positive mechanisms include promoting quality of life, reducing transaction costs, stimulating entrepreneurship, and increasing social interaction. However, as a non-cash payment method, mobile payments may also lead to over-consumption, which is detrimental to residents' happiness. Furthermore, the heterogeneous analysis shows inclusive attributes of mobile payments. We find mobile payments have a greater positive effect on happiness of some socially disadvantaged groups, such as elderly individuals, rural residents, the low-educated, and low-income households. These findings supplement the literature on online happiness and financial inclusion and refer to the possible negative impact of mobile payments. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote mobile payments to benefit more socially vulnerable groups and prevent potential risks from over-consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.},

	abstract = {Electronic payment options have mostly superseded traditional cash payment methods. The growth of digital wallets, e-commerce, mobile payments, and other unusual payment methods has moved the global economy one step closer to a cashless society. Therefore, this study aims to understand how mobile-wallet service quality dimensions affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as to explore users’ experiences with these wallets. The dimensions of the mobile wallet adopted were service quality, ease of use, usefulness, cost, and security. A quantitative approach was used, and a questionnaire was utilized and distributed based on a convenience sample of 557 respondents who were located in Jordan. The statistical techniques of AMOS and SPSS have been applied. The analysis results supported all the main hypotheses, arguing that mobile-wallet service quality leads to customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, mobile wallet service dimensions have an impact on customer loyalty through customer satisfaction. Furthermore, it found that the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived security dimensions have no impact on customer satisfaction. Moreover, perceived ease of use and perceived security dimensions have no impact on customer loyalty. The study recommended the need for m-wallet providers to support m-wallets and other electronic services to enhance the possibility of good control over their technological tools to improve service quality, reduce costs, improve security, develop the relationship between the organization and its customers, and learn more about their desires and aspirations. © 2023 The Author(s).

The results suggest that the cross-country dispersion of the use of payment instruments has declined over time in Europe, and the pace of convergence has picked up since the introduction of the single currency.

It verifies an original model explaining the comparative perception of e-payment as a tool to pay online purchases. The newly integrated variables are the perceived compliance of the e-payment with Islamic Sharia, as a moderator, and the perceived e-shopping value, as a predictor. This investigation also tested the mediating role of e-payment benefits between perceived e-shopping value and e-payment comparative perception. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was distributed, via an online survey, to professional and personal networks of Master students who have spread the survey link to their social media groups. This procedure resulted in 185 valid observations. Findings: Results show that the comparative perception of e-payment systems, as opposed to cash on delivery, is explained directly by e-payment benefits and indirectly by e-shopping value. The comparison of the model paths based on the perceived compliance to Islamic Sharia showed that this variable is non-significant as a moderator. Originality/value: The verified model and paths of this study have not been covered yet, namely, the direct and indirect effects of e-shopping value. Thus, their verification constitutes the main originality of this article. Besides, the verification of the moderating role of compliance to Islamic sharia has not been verified in prior studies about e-payment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Through mundane uses of this new digital cash, they provide a social critique of the centralised infrastructures of the banking industry. This paper outlines an ethnographic research agenda that considers how the social uptake and use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin represents alternative views towards value exchange and critiques existing financial structures. We begin by arguing that the use of Bitcoin can be seen as an act of social resistance that is intended to bridge socio-economic inequalities within the context of a digital community. We then outline the disruptive nature of borderless, affordable and instantaneous international transfers in the form of remittances within social practice. Finally, we identify the possible permutations of trust that may be found in the technical affordances of Bitcoin technology and how these relate to user (pseudo)anonymity, cybertheft, cyberfraud, and consumer protection. Bringing together these three key areas, we highlight the importance of understanding the ordinary (rather than extra-ordinary) uses of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We contend that focusing upon users' interactions with Bitcoin as a payments system and community culture will shed light upon mundane acts of socio-technical disruption, acts that critique and provide alternative financial exchange practices to the payments and regulatory financial infrastructures of the banking industry.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a popular digital currency for online payments, realized as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Bitcoin keeps a ledger of all transactions; the majority of the participants decides on the correct ledger. Since there is no trusted third party to guard against double spending, and inspired by its popularity, we would like to investigate the correctness of the Bitcoin protocol. Double spending is an important threat to electronic payment systems. Double spending would happen if one user could force a majority to believe that a ledger without his previous payment is the correct one. We are interested in the probability of success of such a double spending attack, which is linked to the computational power of the attacker. This paper examines the Bitcoin protocol and provides its formalization as an UPPAAL model. The model will be used to show how double spending can be done if the parties in the Bitcoin protocol behave maliciously, and with what probability double spending occurs. © Chaudhary, Fehnker, van de Pol & Stoelinga.},

	abstract = {The cash on delivery (COD) model has been increasingly used in the last few years as a method of payment for e-commerce transactions. However, little research has empirically investigated the factors that influence customers’ intention to adopt this method as opposed to traditional electronic payment methods. As a result, this paper aims to predict and test the factors that influence the customer’s intention to adopt the cash on delivery (COD) model for e-commerce transaction payments. A research model of key influencing factors and three hypotheses was developed based on previous conceptual research. To test these hypotheses, a questionnaire was designed to collect the data, which were analysed using the partial least squares (PLS) method in SmartPLS software. The results of this study supported the hypothesis that perceived security, privacy and trust exerted significant influence on the customers’ intention to adopt a COD payment system. The interpretation of the results and implications for practise and future research are also discussed. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

There are two types of evidence that the Fed's services improved efficiency. First, the Reserve Banks quickly became major processors of interregional checks, even though banks could have continued to use the prior payments arrangements. The timing of the growth in Reserve Bank collection services was not consistent with the view that banks simply took advantage of a subsidy provided by the Fed. The share of checks collected by the Reserve Banks increased rapidly during the period when the Fed charged banks fees to cover their collection expenses. Second, declines in the ratios of cash to total assets of banks can be attributed to the development of the Fed's check-collection services. © 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the application of e-payment has rapidly increased. However, e-payment has not been able to achieve a trustworthy level in e-commerce transactions. Thus, cash payment methods with Cash On Delivery (COD) services still dominate C2C e-commerce payment transactions in Indonesia. This study aims to investigate factors that affect users' switching intentions from COD to e-payment services. The research model was adopted by using the Push-Pull-Mooring framework, integrating perceived COVID-19 risk, technology acceptance, and transaction effort. Empirical research was conducted using data from 546 COD and e-payment users in Indonesia, with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) being used to validate the model and analyze the hypotheses. The results indicate that switching intention from COD to e-payment is significantly influenced by pull factors in e-payment, which are economic benefits, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and critical mass. There are also two mooring factors that significantly influence the switching intention from COD to e-payment, which are trust and perceived security and privacy. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature in terms of validating a theoretical framework that emphasizes factors that influence user switching intentions from COD to e-payment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research can be a reference for Indonesian payment system regulators and e-payment service providers in formulating regulations and strategies to accelerate the spread of digital transactions in Indonesia. © 2022 by the authors.

In a competitive environment with free entry, these alternative systems are inherently fragile in the sense that they are subject to socially costly bank runs. These social costs are not internalized by private individuals and banks and may exceed their social benefits. We argue that as communication technologies improve, the social benefits of fractional reserve banking decrease, but the private benefits may still exceed the private costs so that such systems continue to be used.

	abstract = {Purpose: M-wallets have emerged as one of the most important financial innovations of the 21st century, enabling users to carry digital cash by securely storing payment methods on their mobile devices. However, the continued use of m-wallets varies among people for several reasons. This study used the technology continuation theory (TCT), gamification and trust factors to examine the variables affecting consumers' intentions to continue using mobile wallets. Design/methodology/approach: The SmartPLS partial least squares software was used to analyze data from 431 m-wallet users in Vietnam using the structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The data revealed that the research model can predict users' intentions to continue using mobile wallets. TCT constructs demonstrated strong exploratory power in explaining consumer satisfaction and attitudes towards m-wallets. Furthermore, the study confirmed the direct effect of the perceived effectiveness of gamification on perceived ease of use and attitude, as well as its indirect effect on consumers' continued use intentions of mobile wallets via attitude. In addition, the trust negatively influenced consumers' intentions to continue using m-wallets. Practical implications: The findings of this study can help researchers, practitioners and policymakers improve m-wallet design, development and adoption, as well as advance financial technology and define the future of digital payments in terms of consumer attraction, engagement and financial inclusion. Originality/value: Based on TCT theory, this study enriches m-wallet research by examining two important factors, gamification and trust, and thus provides insights into how to improve consumers’ intentions to continue using m-wallets in developing countries. This study offers timely insights into theory and practice regarding these factors. It therefore paves the way for researchers and practitioners to learn how easy, enjoyable and secure the end-user experience should be to keep users engaged with m-wallets. © 2024, Saleem ur Rahman, Bang Nguyen-Viet, Yen Thi Hoang Nguyen and Sohail Kamran.},

Furthermore, quality factors consist of system quality, service quality, and information quality, which affect trust and flow directly. Satisfaction is directly influenced by trust and indirectly by the previously mentioned quality factors. Thus, mobile wallet service providers must continue to improve the system quality, service quality, and information quality of their m-wallet applications. The trust factor also influences flow and satisfaction; thus, directly improving the quality can improve the user experience and user satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a consensus network, Bitcoin enables new payment systems and money that are entirely digital or can be interpreted as a virtual currency that uses open source user-to-peer network systems. It offers easier way of payment without the need for a bank account, credit card or intermediary. Bitcoin is cash stored in a computer that can be used to replace cash in an online sale transaction. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how to maximize the opportunities that allow Bitcoin in contributing for Indonesia tax revenue and also, the respond to the growing issues of virtual money transactions in the world. This study uses Literature study method based on some previous research and scientific journals that discuss about Bitcoin as a means of payment in sale and purchase transactions. The results of this study Bitcoin transaction tax still needs to be addressed is the absence of Legal Basis and legislation on legality of Bitcoin as a recognized payment instrument in Indonesia. This study can helps the Indonesian governments for creating a guidelines to adjust the regulation of virtual transactions, which have already been created and implemented in other countries and have a positive impact on the country's economy in addition to being one of the sources of increasing state tax revenues. © 2019, ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

Even though e-shoppers have the option of cash-on-delivery, which seems to be secure and trustworthy, still there is an urge for the e-payment schemes, which can only be provided through banks. Banks act as strong and trustworthy intermediaries in the online transactions and they provide a bold opening in the online business. At present, banks have e-payment systems like Internet banking, electronic fund transfers (NEFT/RTGS), plastic money (credit card & debit card) and mobile banking. These systems provide payment to online transactions like online purchases of products, mobile recharges, hotel booking, ticket booking, etc. by considering all types of security measures. For the real working of these e-services, the need of apt infrastructures is an inevitable feature. This paper examines the efficient utilization of mobile banking by the bank customers who have all the infrastructures for availing the same. The results showed that the majority of the sample customers selected for the study owned a mobile but only few of them use a mobile as their mode of access to banks. They also revealed that the people were comparatively well aware of mobile banking, but its usage level was very low. The mostly used e-settlement with mobile banking was for mobile top-up by urban area customers and rural area customers and there was no significant difference between the urban area and rural area customers regarding the utilization of mobile banking.},

For this study, the focus is on the time period from 2010 to 2018. The data used for this study are tele transfer, through credit or debit card payment, check payment, and E-money on Indian economic growth. The study has employed the panel vector error correction model, Padroni residual cointegration, and the hypothetical prototypical method. The results show that customers and sellers accept a cashless system policy. In the short period, we have a causality model running from a card system to a check payment and telegraphic transfer system, and a causality model running from a telegraphic payment system to a card payment system. In the long period, there is a positive outcome in using a cashless policy on Indian economic growth. However, the use of a cashless policy on Indian economic development in the short term will be negative, whereas in the long term it will impact positively. Hence, any kind of economic strategy that endorses a cashless payment system cannot have positive impact on the economic development directly.  © 2020 ACM.},

Smartcards (multifunctional cards), which bundle payment with non-payment functions (e.g., loyalty programs, identification, and other information functions), have become an increasingly popular payment mode. This shift toward multifunctionality in payment modes is assumed to reduce payment transparency and consequently to decrease consumers’ recall accuracy of past expenditures. We employ a field study to examine recall accuracy for recent purchases with cash, a single-function card, and a multifunctional card. We find that recall accuracy is lower when using a single- or a multifunction card than cash. We also find that it is not the multifunctionality of the card that results in a higher recall error but the individual usage patterns: A higher usage frequency of the non-payment functions results in a higher recall error. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We obtain two main results. First, card users generally have higher disposable income, more financial assets, better financial knowledge, younger household heads, female household heads, higher educational attainment, and are not self-employed compared with only cash users. These findings suggest that an improvement in financial knowledge could increase the usage of credit cards in Japan.

While CBDC offers various advantages for central banks, sensitive transaction and holdings data of individuals and users need to be protected. This paper analyses how privacy in payment is being discussed in CBDC related literature and pilot projects of central banks. Central banks rarely identify privacy as a key requirement in the development and implementation of a CBDC. Instead, anonymity is seen as one possible feature of a CBDC that could hinder know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance of banks. In pilot projects, different techniques and solutions have been proposed to achieve varying levels of privacy for users. A comprehensive framework on how best to achieve privacy in retail CBDC is needed. Such a framework should consider the differing underlying design aspects of a CBDC and the use cases for which the CBDC is to be developed. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

A common concern when using electronic payments is that a user's privacy is sacrificed. However, cryptographic e-cash schemes provide provable guarantees for both security and user privacy. Even though e-cash protocols have been proposed three decades ago, there are relatively few actual implementations, since their computation complexity makes an execution on lightweight devices rather difficult. This paper presents an efficient implementation of Brands [11] and ACL[4] e-cash schemes on an NFC smartphone: the BlackBerry Bold 9900. Due to their efficiency during the spending phase, when compared to other schemes, and the fact that payments can be verified offline, these schemes are especially suited for, but not limited to, use in public transport. Additionally, the encoding of validated attributes (e.g. a user's age range, zip code etc.) is possible in the coins being withdrawn, which allows for additional features such as variable pricing (e.g. reduced fare for senior customers) and privacy-preserving data collection. We present a subtle technique to make use of the ECDHKeyAgreement class that is available in the BlackBerry API (and in the API of other systems) and show how the schemes can be implemented efficiently to satisfy the tight timing imposed by the transportation setting. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

They are used to protect the privacy and identity of the sender from other users, especially in electronic voting and electronic cash payment systems. A number of blind signcryption schemes are introduced over the years and some of them are proved to be insecure. In this Letter, the authors analysed a recently proposed blind signcryption scheme based on elliptic curves and proved it is insecure. Their analysis showed that the proposed scheme is unable to provide the claimed security attributes of message integrity, authentication, unforgeability, and signer non-repudiation. After successful cryptanalysis, they introduced a modified version of this scheme to overcome the security flaws and weakness. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019},

	abstract = {There has been considerable work within the field of digital cash protocols that aims to provide security guarantees - non-repudiation, authentication, overspending checking and off-line checking - whilst protecting anonymity. However, considerably less attention has been given to the question of electronic ticketing, and what exists has been rather abstract or limited. Although eTickets aim at providing the same security guarantees and privacy preservation properties as digital cash, they are significantly different. Digital cash derives much of its anonymity from the fact that the denominations of electronic coins and notes are sufficiently universal that it is not possible for the bank to know in advance how they might be spent. In an eTicketing system, however, this is not the case: at the point the ticket is purchased, the ticket vendor knows for what it will be used and, if a non-anonymous payment system is used, can associate this with the customer. We present a novel protocol that enables users to purchase and spend electronic tickets (eTickets) of a range of two different types: those that can only be used a certain number of times, and those that expire after a certain date. © 2005 IEEE.},

This paper aims to assess the material substance of fiat-backed stablecoins to determine whether fiat-backed stablecoins could be considered, in accordance with IFRS, as cash or cash equivalents. We chose 11 fiat-backed stablecoins representing 99.97% of the total market capitalisation of all fiat-backed stablecoins. Using a three-step approach, we performed an analysis of the legal and general terms and conditions of the selected stablecoins and of cryptocurrency exchanges, and quantitatively analysed their risk characteristics in comparison with fiat currency pairs, money market indexes and instruments, and traditional cryptocurrencies. The results show that nine of the 11 stablecoins met the objective requirements of cash equivalents according to their material substance and, using an extensive interpretation of IAS 7, could be reported as cash equivalents. This study enhances understanding of the material substance of fiat-backed stablecoins for their financial reporting and can be used by entities when creating accounting policies under existing IFRS rules and by accounting standard setters as evidence when formulating new rules or officially interpreting existing ones to provide guidance on the financial reporting of fiat-backed stablecoins. © 2021 CPA Australia},

There are two types of fintech, i.e. card-based electronic wallet and application-based digital cash. The aim of this research is to rank the acceptance factors of e-wallet and digital cash by low income individuals. Initially, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to develop a structural hierarchy of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was followed by interviews with fintech experts to validate the structural hierarchy. Finally, AHP pairwise comparison questionnaires were filled out by 18 respondents, who have experiences using electronic wallet or digital cash. The results show that highest reception factor of both fintech types is ease of use. Speed is the second top rank acceptance factor of electronic wallet, whilst cost-benefit is the second factor of digital cash reception. These findings can enable fintech providers to improve their better marketing strategy, by enhancing their products related its ease of use, speed, and cost. © 2018 IEEE.},

There is extensive literature on the determinants of deposit account access as a measure of financial inclusion, but few studies focus on digital payment use, and none addresses the Peru case at the micro level. This paper uses data from Peru's 2015–2018 National Household Surveys (ENAHO) on the ownership of deposit accounts and payment cards at the individual level and on the use of payment instruments (i.e., cash, credit cards, debit cards, mobile/Internet banking, etc.) for purchasing nine different product categories. Our results show that use of digital payments (e.g., credit card, debit card, or mobile/internet banking) is more likely among people between ages 25–40, with higher education levels, formal employment, and those living in urban areas or with Internet access. In addition, the likelihood of paying with digital instruments increases for people in the top quintiles of per capita household spending and those living in areas with a high presence of financial institutions. Furthermore, we extend the analysis of the determinants for using digital payments across product category and over time (2015–2018). Finally, our work may contribute to understanding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and designing policies related to financial inclusion and digital payment use. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a "showcase." However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), this article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. Implementing a new technology is seen as a long process in which social and technological actors are required to adapt to one another. In the Mondex case, such adaptation did not happen sufficiently to stabilize the sociotechnical network as a whole. However, in some limited areas mutual adaptation did occur, and there the Mondex experiment produced some surprising successes. In this perspective, the story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of mobile devices and new technologies, electronic payments, such as near field communication (NFC) mobile payments, are gaining traction and gradually replacing the currency-based cash payment methods. Despite multiple initiatives by various parties to encourage mobile payments, adoption rates in developing countries have remained low. The purpose of this research is to explore the prime determinants of NFC mobile-payment adoption intention and to develop a model of mobile payment adoption that includes perceived risk (PR) as one of the major elements by extending the UTAUT2 theory components. An online survey was used to acquire data from 370 NFC mobile payments users for the current study. To validate the components and their correlations, structural equation modelling (SEM) was implemented. According to the findings, performance expectancy (PE), hedonic motivation (HM), social influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FC) have substantial impacts on the consumers’ intentions to adopt NFC mobile payments (INFC). Effort expectancy (EE) and PR were reported to have no considerable effects on the adoption intention. In addition, INFC is revealed to be a major mediator between the associations of the actual adoption of NFC mobile payment (ANFC) with PE, HM, and SI. The findings of the study would assist providers and marketers in better understanding of the consumers’ behavior, designing effective marketing strategies to enhance the consumers’ positive intentions, and achieving the mass adoption of NFC mobile payments in different environmental contexts.

	abstract = {"Faceless, Paperless, Cashless". 'Digital India' is a flagship programme of the Government of India that envisions India as a digitally empowered knowledge economy. As India emerges a global competitor in innovative population-scale payment systems, various digital payment methods have been introduced nation-wide, including Micro ATMs, Banking Cards, Internet Banking, UPI (Unified Payment Interface), Mobile Banking, and Mobile Wallets. However, the Indian economy identifies an unapparent barrier between the growth of Digital India and complete acceptance towards Digital Payment System. India's present usage of cash as a payment mode can be measured in the terms of India's cash to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio of 11.4 percent, as of 2019, which is considerably higher than several other developing and developed countries. This also includes costs of cash, such as costs of printing, maintaining cash supply to ATMs, incurred interest and costs due to counterfeit currency, which round up to 10 to 30 percent of India's GDP. This research studies prior literature and consumer behaviour via ground-level surveys and interviews. We also analyse the cryptic challenges faced by users belonging to different age groups towards complete acceptance of digital payments and modes. For instance, a significant proportion of digital users are minors which spurs the need of shared wallets to allow governed transactions by dependent users. Also, symmetric inter-app transactions, intelligent resolution for effective redressal, credible incentivisation, short-term loans, etc. are proposed. As an outcome, a more reliable, secure, and contemporary working model for a Digital Payment Wallet service using Blockchain Technology has been developed.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Mobile application is becoming one of the easiest and fastest options for making payments and is predicted to have a very large potential in the days to come. This study focuses on the customer adoption of mobile payment application. The study reveals that the factors like usefulness, pervasiveness, ease of use, offers and cash back and service assume a vital role in encouraging adoption of mobile payment applications. Results show customers have greater preference towards mobile payment applications over the mobile web browsers, which is a clear sign of awareness among the customers. The study also showed that teenagers are more aggressive in embracing mobile payment application than the older age groups. Compared to other modes of payments, mobile payment with 14.5% preference among customers is low and there is a need for aggressive promotions and marketing campaigns. The study throws light into the customer adoption factors which can act as guidelines for improving customer adoption and awareness of mobile payment applications.

	abstract = {We propose a new lightweight cryptographic payment scheme for transit systems, called P4R (Privacy- Preserving Pre-Payments with Refunds), which is suitable for low-cost user devices with limited capabilities. Using P4R, users deposit money to obtain one-show credentials, where each credential allows the user to make an arbitrary ride on the system. The trip fare is determined on-the-fly at the end of the trip. If the deposit for the credential exceeds this fare, the user obtains a refund. Refund values collected over several trips are aggregated in a single token, thereby saving memory and increasing privacy. Our solution builds on Brands's e-cash scheme to realize the prepayment system and on Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures to implement the refund capabilities. Compared to a Brands-only solution for transportation payment systems, P4R allows us to minimize the number of coins a user needs to pay for his rides and thus minimizes the number of expensive withdrawal transactions, as well as storage requirements for the fairly large coins. Moreover, P4R enables flexible pricing because it allows for exact payments of arbitrary amounts (within a certain range) using a single fast paying (and refund) transaction. Fortunately, the mechanisms enabling these features require very little computational overhead. Choosing contemporary security parameters, we implemented P4R on a prototyping payment device and show its suitability for future transit payment systems. Estimation results demonstrate that the data required for 20 rides consume less than 10KB of memory, and the payment and refund transactions during a ride take less than half a second. We show that malicious users are not able to cheat the system by receiving a refund that exceeds the overall deposit minus the overall fare and can be identified during double-spending checks. At the same time, the system protects the privacy of honest users in that transactions are anonymous (except for deposits) and trips are unlinkable. © 2015 ACM.},

To combat these problems, we propose a Secure Card-less Transaction System- a method which would eliminate the usage of ATM PIN and physical cards altogether and hence provide a secure environment for cash withdrawal.

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent innovations in payment instruments have fundamentally changed the ways we pay. These innovations, such as mobile/SMS payments and online banking, contain features that are likely to influence how people choose to pay. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors that impact payers’ choice of payment instruments. Design/methodology/approach: Through in-depth interviews using the repertory grid technique, the authors explored 15 payers’ perceptions of six payment instruments, including coins, banknotes, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and online banking. The approach draws heavily on organizational systematics to better understand payers’ choice of payment instruments. Findings: A four-category taxonomy of payments was developed. The authors refer to the taxonomy as the 4Ps: the purchase, the payer, the payment instrument, and the physical technology. The taxonomy comprises 16 payment characteristics consisting 76 payment features that influence payers’ instrument choice. One characteristic not known in prior research was identified – that is, “cancellation” – a characteristic more frequently associated with digital payment instruments than with cash or checks. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that payers view payment instruments in a much broader sense, including context, control, or cultural beliefs. Consequently, the authors suggest that researchers try to understand the essence of an innovation before assuming any economic rationalism in human or organizational behavior. The authors also urge researchers to understand the underlying meaning behind constructs of interest; as this study has shown that concepts like context and convenience have many different interpretations. Practical implications: According to McKinsey (2014) there are over 12,000 startups in the payment arena. For them, the taxonomy can function as a template for the design of payment instruments, as well as understanding the various factors that influence payer choice of payment instruments. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is the 4Ps taxonomy of payments. The taxonomy builds on and extends the work by Hirschman (1982). Since this work, and despite recent trends in payments, there has not been a comprehensive investigation that takes into account more recent innovations in payment instruments. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We analyze the impacts of CBDCs and stablecoins on the choice of whether to use cash or deposits. We also examine how the agent changes her portfolio compositions in response to exogenous macroeconomic policies. If a government replaces cash with a CBDC, the convenience of digital currency would not affect consumer choices. The higher the government’s interest rate on CBDCs, the more consumers will use CBDCs than deposits. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Consumer decisions regarding retail payment instruments entail private and social costs. Due to these social costs, policymakers are increasingly trying to understand the determinants of consumer payment choices as documented by the European Central Bank’s regular publications. This article contributes to this understanding by investigating the role of perceived risk. Based on an original survey of French consumers, we measure the effects of perceived risk on the decisions to hold and use the main retail payment instruments: cash, card and cheque. We point to the sequential dependence of the decisions to hold and use a payment instrument, and study jointly both decisions.

A well functioning digital payment system has much relevance on overall economic activity, monetary policy, and financial stability of a country. This study tries to verify the impact of digital payments on the economic growth of India. The economic growth is measured through a proxy – real Gross Domestic Product. Digital payments are measured using Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) operated systems, paper clearing, retail electronic clearing, Card payments, and Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs). Data for digital payments and real GDP are collected from the year 2011 to 2019. Ordinary Least Square Regression, Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ADRL) co-integration approach and ARDL Bounds test are employed for the analysis. The study results reveal that digital payments impact economic growth significantly in the short run. But, digital payments don’t impact economic growth in the long-run. © BEIESP.},

To fully implement this system, four applicative protocols have been developed: two protocols manage the entrance and the exit operations for close parks, while the other two manage the interaction of the user with the kiosk, enabling respectively the load of the money on the phone and the cash payment. The underlying structure of the system foresees the presence of the corresponding softwares performing the protocol operations and interacting directly with the NFC memory of the phone for the read/write tasks, and of a database collecting all the information concerning the presence and the payment of the users.},

	abstract = {Due to the popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the increasing digitalization of payments, and the constantly reducing role of cash in society, central banks have shown an increased interest in deploying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could serve as a digital cash-equivalent. While most recent research on CBDCs focuses on blockchain technology, it is not clear that this choice of technology provides the optimal solution. In particular, the centralized trust model of a CBDC offers opportunities for different designs. In this paper, we depart from blockchain designs and instead build on ideas from traditional e-cash schemes. We propose a new style of building digital currencies that combines the transaction processing model of e-cash with an account-based fund management model. We argue that such a style of building digital currencies is especially well-suited to CBDCs. We also design the first such digital currency system, called Platypus, that provides strong privacy, high scalability, and expressive but simple regulation, which are all critical features for a CBDC. Platypus achieves these properties by adapting techniques similar to those used in anonymous blockchain cryptocurrencies like Zcash to fit our account model and applying them to the e-cash context. © 2022 ACM.},

Would this problem be solved if a new form of currency was introduced, i.e., central bank digital currency (CBDC), in the economy? To answer this question, we construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze the effectiveness of NIRP upon the introduction of CBDC. The results suggest that: (i) The CBDC can eliminate the ZLB constraint and stabilize the economic fluctuations caused by NIRP. (ii) The central bank can implement NIRP by directly adjusting the interest rate of digital currency to stimulate consumption, investment, and output and to accelerate macroeconomic recovery. (iii) Welfare analysis shows that the central bank can effectively choose different NIRP rules according to the economic objectives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the potential impact on securities settlement systems (SSSs) of a major market disruption, caused by the default of the largest player. A multi-period, multi-security model with intraday credit is used to simulate direct and second-round settlement failures triggered by the default, as well as the dynamics of settlement failures, arising from a lag in settlement relative to the date of trades. The effects of the defaulter's net trade position, the numbers of securities and participants in the market, and participants' trading behavior are also analyzed. We show that in SSSs - contrary to payment systems - large and persistent settlement failures are possible even when ample liquidity is provided. Central bank liquidity support to SSSs thus cannot eliminate settlement failures due to major market disruptions. This is due to the fact that securities transactions involve a cash leg and a securities leg, and liquidity can affect only the cash side of a transaction. Whereas a broad program of securities borrowing and lending might help, it is precisely during periods of market disruption that participants will be least willing to lend securities. Settlement failures can continue to occur beyond the period corresponding to the lag in settlement. This is due to the fact that, upon observation of a default, market participants must form expectations about the impact of the default, and these expectations affect current trading behavior. If, ex post, fewer of the previous trades settle than expected, new settlement failures will occur. This result has interesting implications for financial stability. On the one hand, conservative reactions by market participants to a default - for example by limiting the volume of trades - can result in a more rapid return of the settlement system to a normal level of efficiency. On the other hand, limitation of trading by market participants can reduce market liquidity, which may have a negative impact on financial stability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We first discuss how implementing negative rates on reserves held at a central bank does not pose any theoretical difficulty, with a reduction in rates operating in exactly the same way when rates are positive or negative, and show that this is compatible with an endogenous-money point of view. We then propose a simplified stock–flow consistent macroeconomic model where rates are allowed to become arbitrarily negative and present simulation evidence for their stabilizing effects. In practice, the existence of physical cash imposes a lower bound for interest rates, which in our view is the main reason for the lack of effectiveness of negative interest rates in the countries that adopted them as part of their monetary policy. We conclude by discussing alternative ways to overcome this lower bound, in particular the use of central-bank digital currencies. © 2019 The Author.},

	abstract = {With the development of information technology, increasing retailers cooperate with third-party payment platforms (3PPs) to provide mobile payment service for consumers. The entry of 3PPs into supply chains, not only changes the cash flow, but also decreases consumer price sensitivity and stimulates demand by facilitating credit consumptions. Moreover, information sharing becomes more feasible with the help of 3PPs. To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PP’s profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP.

Digicash's E-cash is one of the most popular electronic payment systems in use today. It is an Internet based system with full user anonymity by the use of blind signatures (D. Chaum, 1982). The central authority must apply a signature on a blinded user generated token. The Internet Keyed Protocol was designed by IBM's research labs. It is an adequate system for transactions using credit cards or account numbers on open networks, such as the Internet. iKP (P. Janson and M.

The aim of the article is to interpret and classify central bank digital currencies, to identify key characteristics of digital currencies and possible models of their issue, as well as to define the main directions of influence of digital currencies on the monetary and credit and payment systems. The scientific novelty of the article is in the systematization and comparison of different ideas about the implementation of sovereign digital currencies considering the use of distributed registry technologies. The study analyzed the projects of central banks on the issue of digital currencies and identified their features. Possible directions of influence of central bank digital currencies on the monetary and credit policy of the Central Bank and the activities of credit institutions were determined. It revealed that central bank digital currencies can be considered as a new form of money of the Central Bank, which can be issued to be used both in retail and in wholesale payments. Digital currencies may differ in some characteristics. The key ones are: A way to integrate into the monetary and credit system; emission technology; currency storage method; mechanism of mutual settlements and anonymity level. The study showed that the main incentives for introducing digital currencies are the possibility to provide an alternative and universally accessible legal means of payment, as well as to provide faster, more transparent and cheaper in-country and cross-border payments. The influence of digital currencies on the monetary and credit system and the monetary and credit policy of the Central Bank will largely depend on the scenario of their system integration. If cash is simply replaced in circulation by digital currencies, the effect on the Central Bank monetary and credit system and policy will not be significant. However, if central bank digital currencies are issued as an addition to cash, or are in parallel circulation, they can strengthen the transmission mechanism of the monetary and credit policy and increase the centralization of assets on the Central Bank balance sheet, as well as reduce the funding provided by credit institutions. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice.

Activity-based micro-pricing is a pervasive technology to influence people's behavior through economic incentives. Implementing activity-based micro-pricing based on cryptocurrency technologies enables us to solve potential technical issues of traditional implementation. The Blockchain-LI architecture adopts a hierarchical currency network containing two types of currencies. The public coin is widely prevalent and has high integrity. The private coins are low integrity digital currencies that connect to the public coin. This approach enables us to solve cryptocurrency problems including scalability and block size. However, to use Blockchain-LI as a social infrastructure system, unresolved problems remain.

This study examined the current status of informal payments in Turkey and the opinions, attitudes, and behavior of individuals toward informal payments. To examine this concept, 1,033 residents in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, were surveyed. The 28-item questionnaire used in data collection was developed based on previous research and expert opinions. The data analysis revealed that approximately 29% of the study participants made informal payments in return for the medical service they received. Three out of 4 people who made informal payments were from a low-income group. Informal payments were made in the form of cash prior to medical procedures and also as gifts following the procedures. Future recommendations for health policymakers include designing a new patient copay mechanism where informal payments can be effectively incorporated into the formal payment system, assistance to low-income individuals, and improvement in current medical staff salaries that would discourage taking such payments. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

These game elements contribute to shaping up customer’s motivation and loyalty. Gamification is explored from the lens of both empirical as well as an experimental methodological standpoint. There still lacks substantial evidence that explains how, and which types of rewards help to understand the customer’s motivation. The study addresses this gap by designing an experimental study of 2x2 to address how gamified mobile apps used for making payments can help capture customer’s loyalty by offering them rewards. Data is collected from 385 customers who have been using mobile apps to make payments in the past. The data were tested to check if gamification positively helps the user hedonic and utilitarian motivation, which then positively impacts their loyalty. The study is also moderated by type of rewards (direct cash rewards v/s indirect third party partnered rewards) on the relationship of gamification and customer loyalty mediated through motivation. The results confirm that mobile payment apps’ cash rewards are more useful, especially when the degree of uncertainty in the game element is high (scratch card). Additionally, they contribute to a higher degree of utilitarian benefits to the customers. The results contribute to the extension of the self-determination theory and stimulus organism response framework as well. © 2021. authors.},

Transferability in an e-cash based system means that when a payee receives an electronic coin in a transaction he may spend it without depositing the coin first and getting a new coin issued from a bank. Usually electronic coins that are transferred in a transaction have a lifetime of the transaction itself. In this paper, we propose a payment system where coins can be transferred over multiple hands, spread over various transactions, similar to physical cash. Detection or prevention of double spending of coins is a critical issue in online e-cash payment systems. In our system the verification is distributed across multiple entities as opposed to the case of a coin-issuing entity or a central bank alone being responsible for the verification. A resolution mechanism for handling disputes is also presented. The proposed system provides guarantees of anonymity, fairness and transferability. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

It proposes that given the expansion of the range of personal payment instruments, the choice for payment is now influenced by many factors, including the type of financial provider and potential benefits for consumers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an exploratory study that uses data from the qualitative research conducted in three Russian cities (Moscow, Yekaterinburg and Saratov) based on 50 online payment diaries and 12 group discussions. It was complemented by the analysis of consumers’ posts on six relevant media platforms. Findings: The results show that a bank card is a new must and people choose it for convenience, safety and access to online purchases inside and outside Russia. Cash is used out of habit or wherever cashless payments are either not free or unavailable. Reasons for smartphone pass-through wallet usage include speed, attribute of style and higher cashbacks. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the study are similar to any qualitative research and include, in particular, lack of generalization. Proposed hypotheses might be further tested quantitatively on a representative sample. Practical implications: The results might help providers of financial services in creating better quality products that address consumer pain points and in developing strategies that allow for the changing preferences of consumers. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first such study to consider reasons for choosing and pain points from using certain payment instruments in the emerging markets, in particular, Russia. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The cashless payment in Thailand consists of credit cards, automated teller machines, direct debit, mobile/Internet banking, e-Wallet, PromptPay, and QR code. The cashless payment is able to assist the government for tax collection accuracy and facilitates users to make financial transactions more transparent and efficient. In addition, the cashless system provides benefits to businesses in which they are able to increase sales and expand business by providing convenient, safe and faster services to customers in making payment for goods/services. It assists businesses to save time and cost of cash management and reduce the paperwork. The cashless payment made the life of students, housewives, and elderly people very easy to carry out financial transactions and there is no need to meet the financial institution staff. This payment system needs advanced technology system skills, a smartphone, and a technology facility. Finally, the cashless payment can reduce the spreading of COVID-19. © 2020.

Among the services is the e-payment which enables payment done via the electronic medium and without involving any physical cash. E-Payment systems have received different acceptance level throughout the world - some methods of e-payment are highly adopted while others are relatively lower. Primarily, perceived risk associated to the payment systems is believed to be one of the contributing factors to the low adoption rate. This study aimed to identify young adult's perception of e-payment risk and their behaviour towards different payment methods. For the data collection purpose, survey questionnaires were distributed to students from tertiary institutions in a metropolitan city in Malaysia as the study sample. The findings showed significant difference in perceived risk between cash and E-Payment but less significant in terms of volume of purchase. We discuss the implications of the findings to service providers and policy makers and offer some recommendations to improve the epayment systems quality. Finally, the limitations of study and future directions of research are discussed.},

	abstract = {We have recently seen two conflicting trends in the use of cash. The share of e-payments in retail transactions is steadily increasing, but the same upward trend is true for the share of cash in circulation or at least the cash share remained unchanged. This paper shows the significance of perceived risk for consumers’ precautionary demand for cash after they make a decision to use e-payments. We use data from a study involving Polish consumers. The main conclusions are as follows: surveyed consumers perceive a level of risk associated with card and mobile payments and continue to carry cash for precautionary reasons. Factors such as the consumer’s mental state, lack of trust in e-payments, and attitude to risk influence the decision to maintain cash reserves, while the consumer’s income and age may be considered the main determinants of the value of the cash reserve. Consequently, the decision to use e-payments does not necessarily mean that the demand for cash drops to zero. A degree of difficult-to-reduce, autonomous demand for cash may exist independent of the traditionally studied determinants, in particular, those related to the transaction demand. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) aspire to offer a digital replacement for physical cash and as such need to tackle two fundamental requirements that are in conflict. On the one hand, it is desired they are private so that a financial "panopticon'' is avoided, while on the other, they should be regulation friendly in the sense of facilitating any threshold-limiting, tracing, and counterparty auditing functionality that is necessary to comply with regulations such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) as well as financial stability considerations. In this work, we put forth a new model for CBDCs and an efficient construction that, for the first time, fully addresses these issues simultaneously. Moreover, recognizing the importance of avoiding a single point of failure, our construction is distributed so that all its properties can withstand a suitably bounded minority of participating entities getting corrupted by an adversary. Achieving all the above properties efficiently is technically involved; among others, our construction uses suitable cryptographic tools to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks, it showcases a novel traceability mechanism with significant performance gains compared to previously known techniques and, perhaps surprisingly, shows how to obviate Byzantine agreement or broadcast from the optimistic execution path of a payment, something that results in an essentially optimal communication pattern and communication overhead when the sender and receiver are honest. Going beyond "simple'' payments, we also discuss how our scheme can facilitate one-off large transfers complying with Know Your Transaction (KYT) disclosure requirements. Our CBDC concept is expressed and realized in the Universal Composition (UC) framework providing in this way a modular and secure way to embed it within a larger financial ecosystem. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

In practice, however, it translated into forms of insecurity, which served to promote and reproduce precarity.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper is divided into two parts. The theoretical part reviews the relevant academic literature and discusses the role of cash as a dominant medium of exchange in the underground economy. The empirical part is grounded on a qualitative analysis of several case studies of fraudulent encashment schemes all of which illustrate how reverse money laundering works. Findings – The findings suggest that fraudulent encashment, a type of reverse money laundering, is performed via bank and non-bank institutions. Importantly, methods and techniques used in conventional forms of money laundering are also used in reverse money laundering schemes. Originality/value – Despite a large volume of literature on money laundering, reverse money laundering remains an understudied area. This paper discusses the peculiarities of illegal transfers of non-cash assets into cash, which have been the pronounced problem in Russia and other post-Soviet countries since the 1990s. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Such systems have recently been given considerable attention by both theory and development projects. However, in most current schemes, loss of a user device containing electronic cash implies a loss of money, just as with real cash. In comparison with credit schemes, this is considered a serious shortcoming. This article shows how untraceable electronic cash can be made loss tolerant, i.e., how the monetary value of the lost data can be recovered. Security against fraud and preservation of privacy are ensured; strong loss tolerance means that not even denial of recovery is possible. In particular, systems based on electronic coins are treated. We present general design principles and options and their instantiation in one concrete payment system. The measures are practical.},

Within a wide range of academic contributions, payment choice models based on transaction sizes (TS models) have been promoted. However, TS models induce strong predictions about the use of payment instruments. In particular, all equal-sized transactions are supposed to be paid with the same payment instrument. We propose a simple alternative model based on cash holding (CH model) that allows equal-sized transactions to be paid for in cash or with other payment instruments. Using micro-level payment data from two representative samples of the French population in 2005 and 2011, we test how well each model replicates the observed shares of cash payments in the French economy for each size of transaction. We find that the CH model outperforms TS models, as it better predicts the observed shares of cash payments with notably less demanding information on individuals.},

	abstract = {This study aims to answer two questions: What determines the adoption and use of mobile payment? What is the relationship between mobile payment and access to traditional bank services? By using representative survey data in rural China, we apply a hurdle model with 2SLS and find that consumers with better access to bank services are more likely to adopt mobile payment. However, after adoption, the less often the consumers visit banks because of distance or social constraints, the more they use mobile payment to complement bank services. Younger, better educated households with higher income and more smart phones are more likely to adopt and use mobile payment. Among these characteristics, age has the largest marginal effect while income has the least. Households in the agricultural sector are least likely to adopt and use mobile payment. We also find that awareness of neighbors' use of non-cash payment has a substantial positive effect. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Maitland and Boyd proposed at ICICS 2001 an offline electronic cash system based on a group signature scheme. Their scheme cannot be used to solve blackmailing and other anonymity problems such as money laundering and illegal purchases. Chen, Zhang and Wang suggested an offline electronic cash scheme to prevent blackmailing by using the group blind signature. In their payment system, they used a group signature scheme of Camenisch and Stadler for large groups which is not secure. In this paper we improve these electronic cash systems to prevent blackmailing, money laundering and illegal purchases by using a secure coalition-resistant group blind signature scheme. © 2006 Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.},

	abstract = {To move into a cashless society, it is important to investigate how consumers’ behaviour changes, particularly in response to extraordinary circumstances. Despite the movement restrictions implemented, the acceleration of e-commerce, initiatives taken by the government, and the modern payment system in Malaysia, cash remains the prevalent payment method. Hence, this study investigates how the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis influenced consumers’ perceptions and determines factors contributing to consumers’ behavioural intention to use cashless payment. The research framework for this study is based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The study collected a total of 463 responses from the online survey. The data of this study were analysed using partial least square modelling techniques. This study demonstrates that the crisis significantly and positively influences consumers’ perceptions of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. All of these factors explain consumers’ behavioural intention to use cashless payment, except facilitating conditions. The findings acknowledge the impact of the health crisis on consumer perceptions and influence their behavioural intentions to use cashless payment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive model explaining customers’ continuance usage of mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating both the pull (positive) factors of mobile payment and the push (negative) factors of cash payment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted on 508 mobile payment users. A quota sampling method was applied to collect the data. Then, the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. This study employed SPSS and LISREL software. Findings: This study reveals that four antecedent factors: favorable attitude toward mobile payment, social influence, facilitating conditions and unfavorable attitude toward cash payment, positively affect the continuance intention to use mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding also corroborates the effect of continuance intention on the actual use of mobile payment. Practical implications: This research provides valuable insights for formulating business strategies. The results indicate that mobile payment providers should not only consider the positive aspects of mobile payments but also the negative aspects of cash payment when encouraging the continuance usage of mobile payments to customers. Originality/value: This study is among the first to empirically test the effect of unfavorable attitudes toward cash payment on the continuing use of mobile payment. Specifically, the research extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by adding the push–pull-mooring model to enhance the explanatory power. © 2022, Istijanto and Indria Handoko.},

However, complete anonymity prevents monitoring financial transactions and following the money trail, which are important tools for fighting serious crimes. To solve these type of problems several “escrowed cash” systems, that allow a “Trustee” to trace electronic money, were suggested. In this paper we suggest a completely different approach to anonymity control based on the fact that law enforcement is mainly concerned with large anonymous electronic payments. We describe a payment system that effectively limits the amount of money a user can spend anonymously in a given time frame. To achieve this we describe a technique to make electronic money strongly non-transferable. Our payment system protects the privacy of the honest user who plays by the rules, while introducing significant hurdles for several criminal abuses of the system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

As the country keeps developing, Indonesia has planned to integrate its payment towards a cross-border payment using QR codes by 2025 in the South East Asian region. Facing government vision, MSMEs that act as the significant economy wheel in Indonesia was required to be prepared to face the multi-cultural, multi-currency, and the new tech innovation for doing transactions. However, as a developing country, Indonesia faced significant problems with its infrastructure, which made it hard for merchants to access digital payment. As infrastructure was a common problem for developing countries, Indonesia also faced financial inclusion, lack of digital knowledge, a high amount of cash use, and socialization that made low digital payment penetration. Therefore, as there was a need to increase digital payment penetration for ASEAN integrated payment, this study found that merchant compatibility, facilitating conditions, trust, and relative advantages are drivers for MSMEs using this payment method. Further, this research provides propositions for banks, financial institutions, and governments to develop and evolve towards a cashless ecosystem, especially for a country lacking infrastructure. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

In electronic commerce, customers use electronic money (e-money) instead of cash. E-money in wide use includes electronic cash, electronic checks, electronic coupons, and so on. E-money is fixed at face-value and is backed by banks. The fact that e-money is not issued in the actual amount to be used, it is somewhat inconvenient for customers to use. In addition, security requirements consume huge amounts of computing resources. Limited computing capability makes it is difficult to engage in electronic commerce with mobile devices. This study presents a new payment system, wherein customers are not required to purchase e-money of a fixed value in advance. The amount of every transaction is deducted directly from the customer's bank account, eliminating the inconvenience of fixed value currency, and reducing online computing requirements. Through the application of trapdoor hash functions to streamline computational processes, the system can be used with mobile devices. We have named the system, mobile banking payment system.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an explanation for both the rapid growth in the use of a debit card over time and the cross-sectional difference in the use of a debit card using a search-theoretic model. The trade-off between cash and a debit card as means of payment is incorporated such that a buyer incurs disutility cost proportional to the amount of cash holdings, while a seller accepting a debit card bears a fixed record-keeping cost regardless of transaction amount. As record-keeping cost decreases with the development of information technology over time, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade eventually exceeds record-keeping cost so that all the agents with different wealth levels choose to use a debit card as a means of payment. Also, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade would be higher for the rich than for the poor, implying the cross-sectional feature of payment pattern that the rich use a debit card more frequently than the poor. There are two distinct mechanisms that improve welfare as record-keeping cost decreases: one is to reduce deadweight loss from holding cash and the other is to reduce its distortionary effect on output produced in pairwise trade. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Its irreversibility, pseudonymity and unforgeability have made great developmental leaps in means of payment and investment management. However, when the application of the means of payment is applied in small and medium-sized enterprises or companies, bitcoin lacks the mechanism to be jointly managed. We propose a Distributed Bitcoin Account Management (DBAM) framework that realizes joint management of bitcoin accounts applied especially to enterprises and companies. The framework incorporates secret sharing and attribute based encryption schemes compatible with the existing bitcoin protocols. Each bitcoin account achieves fine-grained management of participants and prevents the private key from being unexpectedly recovered. Thorough analyses show that our framework is secure, practical and effective. © 2016 IEEE.},

The top ten scenarios related to the digital divide of the elderly are extracted, which are mobile, payment, phone, QR code, technology, WeChat, Alipay, cash, insurance and medical. The attention distribution of different scenarios in major cities in China was investigated and classified. The results suggest that the health code, social media, and online insurance need higher policy attention to promote narrow digital divide measure. And an inconsistency between netizens' attention and news reports makes Internet search behaviors have the potential to be a real-time supplement to narrow the digital divide among the elderly. The problem states of different cities reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal asynchrony. The proposed method timely tracks the scenarios of the elderly's digital divide, providing effective insights and references to policy making and services and products improvement, and also providing suggestions for optimizing the development of “Internet +” aging. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, electronic retail payment mechanisms, especially e-commerce and card payments at the point of sale, have increasingly replaced cash in many developed countries. As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using cash. To address this concern, we propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both e-commerce purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. Our proposal introduces a government-backed, privately-operated digital currency infrastructure to ensure that every transaction is registered by a bank or money services business, and it relies upon non-custodial wallets backed by privacy-enhancing technology, such as blind signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transaction counterparties are not revealed. Our approach to digital currency can also facilitate more efficient and transparent clearing, settlement, and management of systemic risk. We argue that our system can restore and preserve the salient features of cash, including privacy, owner-custodianship, fungibility, and accessibility, while also preserving fractional reserve banking and the existing two-tiered banking system. We also show that it is possible to introduce regulation of digital currency transactions involving non-custodial wallets that unconditionally protect the privacy of end-users. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation efforts in many countries as they try to contain the virus. With the physical handling of cash posing as a potential virus transmission risk, digital payments have become important in the urgent transition to a cashless society and a key feature of smart city projects. Critical analyses have typically framed smart cities as neoliberalist developmental projects that see the partnering of the state with private corporations. However, it is unclear how the smart city emerges under the technocratic inclinations of the developmental state. Focusing on the digital payments project under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, this paper unpacks the discursive practices employed in mobilising citizen support for electronic payments through a critical analysis of publicly available government materials and recent initiatives. The discourse surrounding digital payments is bound up in narratives surrounding economic competitiveness, technological progress and public health and safety, and strongly rooted in a technocratic governance ethos that limits genuine citizen participation in shaping smart payments technologies. This paper argues that such discursive framings represent a missed opportunity to build a smart city that is truly citizen-centric. This reorientation requires more bottom-up and grassroots-based modes of governance that reformulate smart citizenship into one that pays greater attention to the affective and social contexts behind digital technologies. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2021.},

	abstract = {The advent of the Internet envisions a cashless society by enabling financial transactions through digital payments. Significantly, the emergence of coronavirus (COVID-19) disrupted our traditional cash handling means and triggered an inflexion point for switching towards contactless digital payments from physical cash payments. Furthermore, Internet of Things (IoT) technology escalates digital payments to the next level by enabling devices to render goods and services without requiring any human interaction. This research proposed an IoT-enabled cashless vending machine that incorporates both cloud computing and payment gateway for ordering and purchasing items through digital payment systems by using a mobile application. The system enables a pre-installed mobile application to scan the Quick Response (QR) code attached to the body of a vending machine, opens the portal of a web-based virtual machine through the code, allows user to choose and order items from the virtual vending, initiates and authorizes a digital payment through an IoT gateway installed inside the physical vending machine by establishing a connection between user's and vendor's financial entities, and finally, dispenses the ordered items by unlocking the shelves of the vending machine after the successful payment transaction. It operates in the Arduino platform with an ATmega 2560 Microcontroller and Esp8266 Wi-fi module as hardware components, mobile application software, and payment gateway API. The system performed an average response time of 14500 milliseconds to pick a product after running 150 consecutive API test calls. This result shows a satisfying time for enhancing customers' buying experiences with digital payment systems and a customizable and cost-effective IoT-based intelligent vending machine to introduce for mass production. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {The pandemic has brought about a shift in the way people perform contactless payments using mobile apps, with QR codes becoming increasingly popular as customers can pay for goods and services without having to physically handle cash or cards. Drawing on the protection motivation theory (PMT), this research aims to reveal retail merchants’ psychological fears of the COVID-19 virus, potentially carried by banknotes, which impact their decision to use QR-based mobile payment (m-payment) services. Structural equation modeling via SmartPLS was utilized to examine the data acquired from 448 small merchants and test the proposed hypotheses. The findings revealed that perceived severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy had a positive impact on their continued intention to use m-payments; however, response cost had a negative impact. Furthermore, age, education, and business experience moderated some of the effects of these antecedents on m-payment continuance intention. Through effective awareness campaigns, providers can position m-payment as a worthy alternative to cash, establishing a sense of security and comfort from the disease-based harm that could be caused by the latter. Driven by the new physical distancing norm, a model that explicates one’s fear of microbial infection and contamination transmitted from banknotes is a novel approach to predicting contactless payment adoption. Furthermore, the unique merchant perspective on m-payment adoption contributes to the existing literature that is traditionally centered on the consumer. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.},

This paper argues that the gradual substitution of cash in the Eurozone for a cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology, could lead to great microeconomic and macroeconomic advantages. However, to carry out a political decision of this magnitude, it is necessary to ensure that all agents will have the necessary means to carry out their transactions. Therefore, this paper analyzes the financial inclusion and use of cash in the Eurozone - using microdata from the Global Findex survey of the World Bank - in order to discern whether a proposal to substitute cash for virtual money would be timely or advisable. The descriptive and econometric results show a lower financial inclusion and a greater use of cash in the Eurozone than in monetary areas of similar level of development, although there is great heterogeneity among countries. Likewise, it is observed that the probability of using cash is greater for individuals with lower income and education levels. Based on the results, it is concluded that the possible proposals that advocate the total elimination of cash in the Eurozone should be carried out gradually and with strong public support to the sectors of the population with lower levels of income and education. © 2020 Asociación Cuadernos de Economía.

Standard panel data models suggest that the ratios of (i) aggregate currency in circulation to M1 and, (ii) large denomination banknotes to M1 are both statistically significant determinants of corruption. Tests for reverse causality within a panel Granger framework reveal a uni-directional causality of corruption with the first variable, but a bi-directional one with the second. These findings suggest that a limitation in the supply of high-denomination banknotes, inter alia, could be a tool to fight corruption, and bring to the fore the important role of payment systems, extending an earlier study by Goel and Mehrotra (2012).

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of financial inclusion and financial innovation on corruption, considering the moderating role of education, as well as identify the specific modality of digital inclusion and payments that contribute to corruption reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a representative sample consisting of 46 African countries in three different years 2011, 2014 and 2017. On the data, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), instrumental variables – two stages least squares (IV-2SLS) and two-stage generalized method of moments (IV-2GMM) model estimation methods were employed. Findings: The results suggest that financial inclusion and education significantly reduce corruption. As well, the interaction between financial inclusion and education reduces corruption. Additionally, the authors find that the expansion of bank credit and the use of credit and debit cards are the specific modes of financial inclusion and digital payments that can contribute to corruption reduction. Research limitations/implications: This study awakens policymakers in African countries about the need to consider education as an alternative measure to support financial inclusion and reduce the use of physical cash in transactions for an effective fight against corruption. Practical implications: Regarding practical implications, the study shows that financial inclusion besides reducing poverty for households can contribute to macroeconomic stability in Africa. Originality/value: The study uses a representative sample composed of 46 African countries and considers the role of education in moderating the relationship between financial inclusion and financial innovation on corruption. Furthermore, the study identifies the specific modality of financial inclusion and digital payments that contribute to corruption reduction. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Merchants pay banks a fee on every credit card transaction. These credit card transactions cost American merchants an average of six times the total cost of cash transactions. The variation in fees among credit cards is also large, with some cards, such as rewards cards, costing merchants twice as much as others. The largest component of the fee merchants pay goes to finance rewards programs, which in turn generate more credit card transactions. Although merchants finance the rewards programs, they derive no benefit from them. Rather than generating additional sales, rewards programs merely induce consumers to shift transactions from less expensive payment systems to more expensive rewards credit cards. Why, then, do all consumers pay the same price for purchases, regardless of the means of payment? The answer lies in a set of credit card network rules known as merchant restraints. Merchant restraints prohibit merchants from accepting certain credit cards selectively and from pricing goods and services according to cost of payment. These restraints thus prevent merchants from signaling to consumers the costs of different payment methods. Accordingly, consumers never internalize the costs of their choice of payment system. Merchant restraints thus encourage more credit card transactions at a higher price than would occur in a perfectly efficient market. The restraints also permit card issuers to externalize the costs of rewards programs to merchants and, ultimately, to consumers who do not use rewards cards. This Article argues that merchant restraints distort competition within the credit card industry and among payment systems in general. Further, merchant restraints' economic justifications are unfounded, and they should be banned as antitrust violations.},

Using a qualitative approach, we conduct expert and non-expert interviews to apply and extend existing research on attitude formation to study how individuals form attitudes towards a CBDC in Germany. We find that individuals form their attitudes towards a digital euro through the perceived benefits, limitations, and concerns regarding related payment solutions, moderated through the perceived equivalence of these related technologies and the CBDC. The results contribute to the literature on CBDC and can be used by practitioners to develop a digital euro that offers a competitive advantage for retail transactions over established payment solutions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

In the current scenario most of the transactions were made cashless and in future physical form of currencies will no longer be a king. There are different medium introduced to carry out cashless transactions. Despite the rise of digital payments there is also an increase in the security concerns. Digital payments are bound to have security issues which might hinder the growth of digital payments. Hence, this paper helps to identify the consumers’ perception on cashless transactions, factors influencing cashless transactions and also identify the level of awareness of the consumers concerning the information securities. The findings reveal that the majority of the consumers prefer credit/debit card has the most comfortable mode of payment followed by mobile wallets. Privacy and security, convenience were the factors which influences consumers towards cashless transactions and it was also found that consumers has enough awareness on the information security in cashless transactions. Therefore, digital payments will takes a long time to become key payment option but this might benefit the economy in the near future. © IAEME Publication.},

The ubiquitous nature of smartphones and tablets has widened the ambit for using these devices for payments and other daily life activities. Recent advancements in mobile technology along with the convenience of mobile devices made these applications possible. Despite the worldwide user adoption of mobile applications, security is the key challenge in mobile banking and payments system. Mobile payments systems need to be very efficient and provide utmost security endlessly. State-of-the-art mobile payment systems need the physical presence of a merchant agent to make a payment. In this article, we had described in detail about the design and implementation of a mobile payments application, used to make in-store purchases and make secure payments without any physical presence of a cashier or a merchant agent. We proposed a novel privacy-preserving and secure authentication algorithm to make mobile payments using biometrics. The analysis and experimental results show the reliability and efficiency of our proposed solution. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Cashless economy got popular after demonetization where plastic money was widely used. The study is aimed towards studying the level of awareness among the citizens about cashless economy. The study also helps in determining the factors which influence the people to switch from cash towards cashless payments and what are the benefits people avail by using other means of payments.The primary data was collected by distributing questionnaires to 280 respondents, who have been using any digital mode of payment. Data is collected from students, working professionals and business class people. The questionnaire asks questions about the benefits people avail while using digital payment methods and what are the various factors which influence the people to use digital payment methods and what are the risks they face associated with digital payments.After the research conducted we can say that the working professionals and business class people use digital payment methods more. There are various factors which influence the people to shift such as offers, cashback etc. There is still a long run for India to be cashless to full extent as the government needs to develop a smooth and secure infrastructure. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {EGovernment programs often address problems such as institutional ineffectiveness, lack of transparency, or social exclusion. Financial exclusion and people's reliance on ineffective payment methods appear to be a wellknown problem worldwide. Yet, despite the large number of related case studies and academic reports on the topic, little is understood about the impact governmental payment practices have on the financial behaviour of citizens. Few investigations address how governmental use of payment methods and related policies may impact citizen/consumer behaviour. Through investigating the move to EPayment based methods to replace the dominant use of cash and cheques in social welfare in Ireland, the purpose of this paper is to explore the recipient's view of this government project. The research is organized as an intrinsic case study where the unit of analysis is one large project. It aims at a rich description of one particular case by analysing data collected from two main sources of evidence: preliminary investigation is done by reviewing relevant documents, while primary data collection involved facetoface surveys of social welfare recipients (using a short, structured questionnaire augmented with a few openended questions). The planning and execution of EGovernment programs often face barriers of mostly social and historical nature. As the results of this research indicate, these barriers might be hard to overcome as they are the result of certain behaviours and attitudes rooted in people's daily experience, such as their daily financial reality. Results also imply that the choice of an adequate EPayment method and migration scenario by governmental agencies will be crucial to the outcome. Implementation and education will also be critical. This study reports on the influence governmental decisions related to social welfare payment methods may have on recipients' financial habits regarding the choice of payment options. It also shows how recipients' everyday experience and financial reality determine the way they relate to payment options. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The model consists of seven sectors, namely households, retail firms, wholesale firms, capital producing firms, commercial banks, central bank, and government, and offers rich features. The use of cash and CBDC is differentiated with respect to their prices and transaction costs. In particular, we quantify the effects of negative shock on CBDC transaction cost to evaluate the potential of CBDC as an alternate instrument in liquidity holding in addition to cash and bank deposits. We also examine the effects of productivity shock and monetary policy shock on CBDC interest rate and CBDC demand, and their interaction with other main variables of the model. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {A fair network payment protocol plays an important role in electronic commerce. The fairness concept in payments can be illustrated as that two parties (e.g. customers and merchants) exchange the electronic items (e.g. electronic money and goods) with each other in a fair manner that no one can gain advantage over the other even if there are malicious actions during exchanging process. In the previous works of fair payments, the buyer is usually required to sign a purchase message which can be traced by everyone. The information about where the buyer spent the money and what he purchased would easily be revealed by this way. This paper employs two techniques of off-line untraceable cash and designated confirmer signatures to construct a new fair payment protocol, in which the untraceability (or privacy) property can be achieved. A Restrictive Confirmation Signature Scheme (RCSS) will be introduced and used in our protocol to prevent the interested persons except the off-line TTP (Trusted Third Party) from tracing the buyer's spending behavior. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2003.},

For example, the adaptation of contactless mobile payment has grown in the past two years to avoid unnecessary contact and possible infections. In this study, we intend to examine behavioral intentions that made consumers shift from traditional cash payment to mobile payment during the COVID-19 period. Our research framework and hypotheses were developed and examined through the push (dissatisfaction)–pull (alternative attractiveness)–mooring (perceived fear) model. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate our model and corresponding hypotheses. The results of this study showed that dissatisfaction with tradition-al payments and customer’s perceived fears positively and significantly affected switching intentions. However, alternative attractiveness had no significant impact on consumers’ switching intentions from cash to mobile payments during the pandemic. Moreover, this study shows how perceived fear has a mediating effect that motivates people to change their payment behaviors. Implications and future research directions about consumers changing in such a dynamic time are also discussed. © 2022 by the authors.},

This Article demonstrates empirically that credit card rewards programs are funded in part by a highly regressive, sub rosa subsidization of affluent credit consumers by poor cash consumers. In its worst form, food stamp recipients are subsidizing frequent flier miles. The subsidization is created by a set of credit card network rules called "merchant restraints" that combines with a cognitive bias known as the framing effect to limit merchants' ability to price payment systems according to cost. The Article also shows how the subsidization of credit card use increases the transactional use of credit cards. A set of cognitive biases amplifies increased transacting usage toward an increase in credit card debt. Credit card merchant restraints thus ultimately contribute to credit defaults, reduced consumer savings and purchasing power, inflation, and consumer bankruptcy filings. There are profound policy questions that arise from the social externalities caused by credit card merchant restraints, including whether private control of essential services like payment systems is appropriate. In light of the negative social externalities of credit card merchant restraints, the Article proposes legislative intervention to ban merchant restraint rules.},

	abstract = {Electronic cash is a suitable solution for payment systems, in which the user's identity should not be revealed during the payment. This is for example the case for public transportation payment systems. One electronic cash scheme, efficient during the spending phase, was proposed by Brands'. This scheme, as all privacy-preserving payment schemes, is based on public-key cryptography. However, payment devices used in those systems need to be cheap and low-power, which restricts their computational performance. These two points conflict with the need for payments to be executed quickly, in order to avoid delays at the entrance points of the system. In this work we demonstrate that using sophisticated implementation techniques, it is possible to realize full-size e-cash schemes even on inexpensive payment tokens. We present a full implementation of Brands' offline cash scheme for the UMass Moo, a computational RFID-token. The spending protocol, which is the time critical part in transportation payment systems can be executed in 13 ms. This meets real-world application requirements. The reloading of the card, which is less time critical, as it is conducted offline, is time consuming. We discuss solutions to this problem. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Even roadside shops all over India and other countries have access to online payment which made each and every person to go cash-free. But there is one important issue we need to consider which is the security during online transactions. There are several new techniques that are being developed nowadays but each has its own pros and cons. In order to enhance the security during online transaction, we have introduced a two-way authentication system which increases the security during online transaction. This system includes facial and proxy detection before entering the UPI pin. The algorithm used in this paper, will further improve the security and efficiency of facial recognition since it embeds 128 feature points of the user’s face thereby increasing the accuracy of the system. While the data is being transmitted for verification, we have included tripleDES encryption to further enhance the security of the work. After the verification is done by the system, the bank balance of the user is verified and the transaction is done. The proposed system has better efficiency when compared to the existing works and also its simple UI makes it easy to use. © 2021 Taru Publications.},

In particular, the demand for cash is analysed from this point of view. The analysis is based on a simple spatial transactions model in which banks' optimization problem is solved. The solution quite clearly shows that monopoly banks have an incentive to restrict the number of ATMs to a minimum. More generally, the number of ATMs depends on competitiveness in the banking sector. The predictions of the theoretical analysis are tested using a panel data from 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1988 to 2003. Empirical analysis shows that there is a strong and robust relationship between the number of ATM networks and the number of ATMs (in relation to populations). Moreover, it can be shown that the demand for cash depends on the number of ATMs, ATM networks and the popularity of other means of payment. Thus, the use of cash can be pretty well explained in the transaction demand framework assuming that the market structure and technical environment is properly controlled.},

Overpayments are refunded where all trip refunds of a user are aggregated in a single token thereby saving memory and increasing privacy.

	abstract = {Fair off-line electronic cash (FOLG) schemes [5,29] have been introduced for preventing misuse of anonymous payment systems by criminals. In these schemes, the anonymity of suspicious transactions can be revoked by a trusted authority. One of the most efficient FOLG system has been proposed by de Solages and Traoré [13] at Financial Cryptography'98. Unfortunately, in their scheme, the security for legitimate users (i.e., anonymity) is not clearly established (i.e., based on a standard assumption). At Asiacrypt'98, Frankel, Tsiounis and Yung [17] improved the security of [13] by proposing a fair cash scheme for which they prove anonymity under the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. In this paper, we show that Frankel et al. failed to prove that their scheme satisfies the anonymity property. We focus here on this security problem and investigate the relationships between different notions of indistinguishability in the context of fair electronic cash. As a result, we prove under the DDH assumption, that a straightforward variant of [13], which is more simple and efficient than [17], is secure for users. This proof relies on the subsequent result of Handschuh, Tsiounis and Yung [19] showing equivalences between general decision and matching problems. Our proof is somewhat generic and can be used to prove that [17] is secure as well. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Analysis of each leads me to conclude that deposit insurance, which allows banks to hold insufficient capital, is the only public-policy-justifiable rationale for regulation. This concern can be managed with capital requirements; otherwise, banks should only be regulated as are other corporations. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Demonetization in India has forced all consumers and companies to embrace and create cashless digital payment platforms. The cashless economy scenario involves various factors for its adoption such as reach, availability and awareness. This study considers factors responsible for adopting new digital payment technologies in India’s different regions across various consumers. The study includes descriptive statistics and variance analysis (ANOVA) to identify elements to achieve maximum satisfaction. The research collects data from 250 respondents living in India, experiencing digital payments and online transactions. The data is collected through a structured questionnaire and critically analyzed using statistical analysis. The data has been analyzed with no sectorial biases and tracked by creating real-time indications. The study uses various hypotheses after taking responses from a sample of respondents. Cronbach’s Alpha analysis is also used to determine the validity and reliability of the data. The study illustrates the complete shift of consumer behavior from cash to a cashless economy. A certain number of factors are shown to directly influence the rate of such a shift toward digital transactions in India. © 2021.

	abstract = {In many industrialized countries, cash usage at points of sale has been decreasing owing to competition from alternative means of payment such as credit cards. At the same time, cash demand, measured as currency in circulation over GDP, fell only in earlier years but has remained surprisingly robust in the past two to three decades. This phenomenon, termed the “cash paradox,” poses a challenge to standard monetary models. We introduce two new features into the standard cash-credit model: the substitutability between cash and credit (as a stand-in for alternative means of payments) is uneven across different economic activities, and some agents actively manage cash flows across these activities. Calibration exercises show that the cash-flow channel is important for quantitatively capturing the diverging trends in cash usage and demand. There is also some empirical support for our model's prediction on cash velocity in the retail sector. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

However, little attention has been given to the relevancy of electronic and digital payments (including a possible digital euro) in the area of taxation, where policies limiting the use of cash are being intensively adopted all around the world. On one hand, tax policies fostering the use of electronic and digital payments as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can help tax authorities to better monitor taxpayers’ transactions in the fight against tax evasion and fraud. On the other hand, important concerns arise in the areas of data protection and the digital divide. These two kinds of concern should be taken into account and addressed by policymakers before the adoption of both a CBDC and tax policies favouring its use at the detriment of cash. © 2021 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands},

In this setting, a central bank employs digital currency to transfer digital cash to each household, thus supporting consumption directly when needed. The asset side of the central bank’s balance sheet remains unchanged, and the creation of new digital cash is offset by a decrease in central bank equity. The central bank thus incurs an immediate loss but does not take on any additional risks for its future income statements. We address several objections to this policy, paying particular attention to the claim that weakening the financial strength of the central bank endangers long-term price stability. Through a meta-analysis of 176 estimates reported previously in the literature, we find that central bank financial strength has not historically correlated with inflation performance. © 2019, Association for Comparative Economic Studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Third-party payments were first introduced by the US firm PayPal. Soon after, China developed a localized version of PayPal – Alipay, which became the main payment method for online transactions in China. Currently, the number of global transactions conducted with Alipay is three times that of PayPal. In addition to online transactions, Alipay also integrates with mobile payment applications to provide offline services, making physical transactions more convenient for users. The authors, in this paper, aim to address how third-party payments technology seems to be playing out an innovation-imitation-catch up story. Design/methodology/approach: Krugman (1966) proposed a general-equilibrium model of product cycles under perfect competition where high-tech products are innovated by an “advanced” country and imitated by a “developing” country. The competition between US–China online technologies (e.g. third-party payments) seems to be playing out this innovation-imitation-catch up story. Findings: The USA has already put a lot of effort into the operations of credit cards and checks, as well as other infrastructure such as human resources and installation of relevant systems. China lacks the infrastructure for payments made with credit cards and checks, and therefore China’s opportunity cost of moving directly from cash transactions to third-party payments is much less than that of the USA, which is why China holds follower advantage in third-party payment markets. Originality/value: The third-party payment technologies appear to be a good example of the argument made by Krugman (1966) regarding the US–China competition on advanced technology, which states that an imitator can catch up with an inventor when the former acquires comparative advantages against the latter. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed people’s lives, especially technological advancements. Most service industries have opted to adopt online payments since the pandemic happened. Electric utility companies are one of the major industries that utilize online payments as an alternative mode of payment to traditional cash payments to minimize person-to-person contact. The current study aimed to assess electric utility companies’ service quality and customer satisfaction to improve the payment system. The study was conducted in Occidental Mindoro Electric Cooperative, Inc. (OMECO), which utilized an online payment system due to COVID-19-protocol. The research model comprises 60 questionnaires with ten sections developed from the literature and distributed to 400 participants. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling and path analysis technique. The results showed that Online Payment Security had the most positive effect on service quality, thus affecting customer satisfaction. Moreover, tangibility, reliability, online payment method, and COVID-19-protocol positively affected service quality. While reliability, assurance, and empathy had a negative effect on the service quality of OMECO. Aligning with the result, OMECO was poorly evaluated by the participants in terms of empathy, assurance, responsiveness, and reliability. Moreover, the result of the study can be used by major electric companies to improve their service in terms of online payment. Finally, the current research is one of the first studies that integrate service quality and customer satisfaction while utilizing the structural modeling approach. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Early modern wages is a complex and interesting, but understudied, topic. Historians are well aware that wages involved much more than monetary remuneration. Our knowledge of how people were actually paid for their work is limited, however. This article examines to what extent nominal wages in seventeenth-century Sweden consisted in money, in goods or in other perquisites. Servants, casual labourers and workers in the mining and building industries are studied. The main result is that forms of payment were highly variable, not only between different places of work, but also between labourers at the same location and in the same trade. Rather than customarily determined, wages were adaptable and changed according to individual or local circumstances. The study also found that women were not only paid less but in a different way. The nominal wages studied did not correspond to real sums of money, but were used as benchmark for actual payments. Shortage of cash explains some of this phenomenon. But the limited and uneven supply of market goods more generally also meant that it was sometimes advantageous, or even necessary, for workers to be paid in goods rather than coins. Wages were, moreover, used to cover all sorts of personal expenses, including medical care, childcare, purchases and fines. Early modern wages were negotiable. As in all negotiations, the outcome was contingent on local and practical circumstances as well as on general ideas and the relative positions of the parties. Payments were irregular. This could be because of a lack of means of payment, but it could also be because of the shifting needs of individual wage earners. Different remuneration methods, i.e. piece rate versus time rate, were used at one and the same work place and for the same category of workers. In short, then, early modern wages were not a uniform entity. This should be borne in mind when real wages series are studied and compared. Through their disparity, their negotiable character and through different credit arrangements, they allowed for a much wider flexibility than real wages series suggest.},

The data collected through an online survey across India was analyzed using logistic regression. The findings suggest that product perception influences consumers' choice of payment method.

	abstract = {Pre-industrial China and Japan provide contrasting patterns in how transactions were conducted in the rural economy. Chinese peasants would exchange their products anonymously for cash at the nearest market, while transactions in rural Japan tended to be made among people who were well-acquainted through credit rather than currency. The case of early modern England, where ordinary people tended to make deferred payments by means of oral agreements, shows a similarity to the Japanese situation. This comparison suggests, in general terms, that currency and credit could combine to supply the total amount of means of payment needed in a region. However, commercial activities progressed in divergent ways: either through anonymous currency transactions or by means of chained debts among locals. Unlike currency-dominant systems, which tended to create plural units of account, credit-dominant systems made it easier to establish a monetary system based on a standard formula. © The Author 2012.

Besides, with the current advancement in the Internet as well as the digital transformation, SMEs are being forced to adopt mobile payment systems (MPS). The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) determinants on the adoption of MPS and its impact on SMEs’ firm performance operating in Ghana. This research employed a closed-ended questionnaire to collect data from January 2020 – April 2020. This study used a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach using SmartPLS 3.0 for path analysis of 145 responses. The findings of the study include the statistically significant effects of technological (relative advantage and compatibility), organizational (top management support and employees’ readiness), and environmental (social influence and competitive pressure) factors on the adoption of MPS. Furthermore, this study also proved the positive and statistically significant effect of MPS on SMEs’ performance. This study demonstrated that the TOE factor explains 70% variations in the adoption of MPS. © Copyright: The Author(s)},

The results prove that dissatisfaction with the current payment method has a rather low influence on the intention to switch to mobile payment in comparison with other factors such as perceived usefulness or alternative attractiveness. Furthermore, switching costs have a negative influence on the intention to switch to mobile payment. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office. All Rights Reserved.},

As one of the most disruptive technologies for finance, mobile payment has been rapidly transforming the traditional financial industry. While it brings important benefits, there are also various risks, in terms of liquidity, security, and data privacy, that call for adequate regulatory responses. As a global financial centre, Hong Kong has gradually established a regulatory framework for mobile payment, addressing the relevant risks with rules on payment and privacy. However, there is still room for further improvement, in terms of measures to deal with cybersecurity issues and strengthen the protection of personal data.

	abstract = {Anonymous E-Cash was first introduced in 1982 as a digital, privacy-preserving alternative to physical cash. A lot of research has since then been devoted to extend and improve its properties, leading to the appearance of multiple schemes. Despite this progress, the practical feasibility of E-Cash systems is still today an open question. Payment tokens are typically portable hardware devices in smart card form, resource constrained due to their size, and therefore not suited to support largely complex protocols such as E-Cash. Migrating to more powerful mobile platforms, for instance, smartphones, seems a natural alternative. However, this impliesmoving computations from trusted and dedicated execution environments to generic multiapplication platforms, which may result in security vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose a new anonymous E-Cash system to overcome this limitation. Motivated by existing payment schemes based on MTM (Mobile Trusted Module) architectures, we consider at design time a model in which user payment tokens are composed of two modules: an untrusted but powerful execution platform (e.g., smartphone) and a trusted but constrained platform (e.g., secure element). We show how the protocol's computational complexity can be relaxed by a secure split of computations: nonsensitive operations are delegated to the powerful platform, while sensitive computations are kept in a secure environment. We provide a full construction of our proposed Anonymous Split E-Cash scheme and show that it fully complies with the main properties of an ideal E-Cash system. Finally, we test its performance by implementing it on an Android smartphone equipped with a Java-Cardcompatible secure element. © 2015 ACM.},

The paper defines conditions under which nominal contracts, promising future payment of a fixed number of units of fiat money, prove to be the optimal contract form in the presence of either relative or aggregate price risk. When relative prices are random, nominal contracts are optimal if individuals have ex ante similar preferences over future consumption. When the aggregate price level is random, whether from shocks to the money supply or aggregate output, nominal contracts (perhaps coupled with equity contracts) lead to optimal risk-sharing if individuals have the same degree of relative risk aversion. Finally, nominal contracts may be optimal if the repayment of contracts is subject to a binding cash-in-advance constraint. In this case, a contingent contract increases the risk of holding excessive cash balances.},

To answer these questions, we theoretically and quantitatively assess the effects of a CBDC on consumption, banking, and welfare. Our model captures the competition between different means of payments and incorporates a novel general equilibrium feedback effect from transactions to deposits creation. The general equilibrium effects of a CBDC are decomposed into three channels: payment efficiency, price effects, and bank funding costs. We show that a cash-like CBDC is more effective than a deposit-like CBDC in promoting consumption and welfare. Interestingly, a cash-like CBDC can also crowd in banking, even in the absence of bank market power. In a calibrated model, at the maximum, a cash-like CBDC can increase bank intermediation by 10.2% and welfare by 0.059%, and it can capture up to 23.3% of the payment market. We also discuss some lessons for designing a CBDC. Copyright: © 2023 INFORMS.},

This paper covers 14 CBDC projects and analyzes them according to different factors such as availability, operating model, transactions, architecture, framework, anonymity, and security. As the current work undertaken on CBDC is in the exploration stage, the analysis could be subject to change with time, as new technology and techniques emerge.

	abstract = {We use two quasi-natural experiments that encouraged the use of debit cards and facilitated the use of ATMs in Mexico to estimate the elasticity of crime and informality to the availability of cash as a means of payment. We then construct a simple model to quantify the private costs of restricting cash usage in the economy. Our model captures the degree of substitution between cash and other payment methods at the intensive and extensive margins. We estimate the welfare effects of restricting cash by means of three key inputs: i) the elasticity of substitution between cash and credit, ii) the share of expenditures in cash by type of good obtained from detailed micro data, and iii) the elasticity of crimes to the availability of cash as means of payment. The social benefits of restricting cash usage are driven by the reduction of some criminal activities. The costs arise from the distortions that the anti-cash regulation imposes on the individual choices regarding the means of payment. We find that the private costs of heavily taxing the use of cash in Mexico outweigh the social benefits that we identify. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

In this cash shortage, the nation, that was historically low on mobile payment adoption, was 'pushed' to use digital payment. Though debit/credit cards are traditional digital options, easier to maintain in comparison to mobile wallets, the adoption rate for wallets was surprisingly higher. Environmental events occurring around the same time period include introduction of low cost Internet offering better facilitating conditions, discounts by e-wallets companies, and increased risk perception for payment cards from theft news flocking the media. We propose to investigate the various facilitating and inhibiting factors that accelerated mobile payment adoption above other digital options. © PACIS 2018.},

The purpose of our study is to empirically analyze the users’ intention to adopt digital payment systems, post Demonetisation, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The conceptual framework for the study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) adoption model with added operationalized constructs of Perceived Risk and Stickiness to use Cash. A total of 326 respondents were surveyed using a pre-tested questionnaire during the Nationwide Lockdown 3.0 in India. These responses were analyzed using Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings of the study revealed that performance expectancy and facilitating conditions directly influence the intention of individuals to use digital payment systems, whereas the effect of perceived ease of use on digital payment systems is mediated through the attitude towards the digital payment systems during COVID-19 pandemic situation. Implications of the proposed adoption model are discussed. This will enable the other developing economies to formulate a digital ecosystem, that is here to stay even after the pandemic.1) © 2021, Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

	abstract = {This paper reports from an empirical study of users’ attitudes pertaining to novel payment solutions, particularly e-cash and mobile micro payments (m-payments). This is a particularly important aspect of mobile services development, since cumbersome payment allegedly is a significant barrier to the adoption of mobile commerce. Moreover, it is often seen as a ‘killer’ mobile application in its own right, which is expected to have great ramifications for the industry. This paper questions this assumption. Based on a medium-sized questionnaire (n = 462), which was administered to a sample of mobile phone users, we concluded that the current view of m-payment as a stand-alone ‘product’ has not been very successful. We believe instead that users enjoy tighter integration of ‘trying with buying’. It seems that co-located buying, trying and paying within the same medium comprise the more promising approach. The findings of this paper also confirm that mobility as such is not a particularly strong determinant for mobile services adoption. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

E-cash enables the exchange of digital coins with value assured by the bank's signature and with concealed user identity. In an electronic cash system, a user can withdraw coins from the bank and then spends each coin anonymously and unlinkably. In this paper, we design an efficient anonymous mobile payment system based on bilinear pairings, in which the anonymity of coins is revocable by a trustee in case of dispute. The message transfer from the customer to the merchant occurs only once during the payment protocol. Also, the amount of communication between customer and merchant is about 800 bits. Therefore, our mobile payment system can be used in the wireless networks with the limited bandwidth. The security of the new system is under the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. © 2009 Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.},

The focus is on identifying the most effective techniques and approaches that businesses can use to encourage user adoption of mobile payments. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses survey data from 396 active mobile payment users across the mid-west region of the USA to test the proposed hypothesis. The snowball sampling approach is used to sample the participants for the data collection. This study uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the ten hypotheses proposed in this study. Findings: This study finds that organizational commitment and privacy customization can significantly overcome users’ protective attitudes toward mobile payments during the pandemic. In addition, providing users with privacy customization options can significantly encourage self-disclosure, which is crucial for transaction authentication and fraud detection. Originality/value: Envisioned in the backdrop of the COVID pandemic, this is one of the earliest studies investigating the role of privacy customization, self-disclosure and organizational commitment on mobile payment adoption. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The current study looks toward a partial advance and delays in the payment system considering time-sensitive demand, shortage, and partial backlogging for instantaneous deteriorating items. During the financial crisis, the partial advance and delay-in-payment strategy is planned to keep orders flowing from retailers to suppliers and customers to retailers. The impact of advanced and delayed payments on the total cost of a retailer is examined. To exemplify the model's application, numerical examples are used.

The research results also show the direct and indirect effects of promotion on intent to use. From this result, 7 of 9 research hypotheses were accepted. Promotion, often overlooked by researchers, has been proven to be a critical factor when researching technology adoption because it significantly improves the level of intentional interpretation of the research model.

	abstract = {Recent government attempts at reducing currency demand by promoting cashless payment technology, e.g., subsidies for point-of-sale terminals, have met with mixed success. In this paper, we argue that one reason is the shadow economy: as the size of the unrecorded economy grows, cashless payment technology has a weaker effect on the demand for cash. To test this hypothesis, we analyse a panel of 37 countries over the years 2004–2014 including data on point-of-sale terminals, financial cards in circulation, and the value of total card payments. Using the first principal component of these variables as a proxy for cashless payment technology, we find that a 1% increase in underground activity lowers the impact of cashless technology on the velocity of currency in circulation by 0.3%. This decrease is large enough that the average marginal effect of cashless technology on currency velocity is statistically insignificant for several high-shadow countries over the sample period. Overall, our results suggest that government subsidization of digital payment infrastructure will be ineffective when shadow markets are prevalent. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, there is little understanding of the key factors behind digital wallets' rapid growth in US (Venmo) and China (WeChat Pay). What are the factors that led to their success? How social relationships play a role in their adoption? We conduct a mixed methods study, using a comprehensive survey (N=879) and semi-structured interviews (N=41) to explore the interplay of the two roles of these digital wallets, i.e., a payment system and a social platform. Our analysis suggests that the network effect does benefit their adoption and retention, but through different mechanisms. In return, transaction activities performed in digital wallets help strengthen existing social ties. We also present design implications for future social payment services. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

The combination of cash payments (and low penetration of cheques) in the Spanish retail sector together with increasing administrative costs, acted as incentives for Spanish savings banks embracing applications of computer technology to articulate viable solutions for cost reductions, offer alternative payment systems to cash and facilitate greater diversification. A running comparison is made with similar developments in Britain. Computerization committees had little impact amongst the trustee savings banks (TSB). This responded to a combination of a poor corporate strategy and a number of external events. By the mid-1970s it was evident that the trustee savings banks had lost a significant share of the total domestic deposits in sterling. Meanwhile, collective investments in computer technology applications were instrumental for Spanish savings banks to successfully contest the domestic retail bank market.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recently, the Government of India has emphasized digital financial inclusion for promoting cashless transactions with a vision to transform India from a traditional cash-based economy into a cashless economy. Technology-driven payment apps are facilitated greater access to cashless financial services and improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of financial transactions. This study aims to explore the determinants of quick response (QR) code mobile payment (m-payment) adoption intention among marginalized street vendors in India. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed research model was tested using 320 responses from QR code m-payment users. An interview schedule was performed using the structured questionnaire from marginalized street vendors by adopting a purposive sampling technique. The proposed research framework of this study developed on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). In addition to the existing variables proposed in the UTAUT model, three more variables have been added, namely, digital financial literacy (DFL), personal innovativeness (PI) and perceived trust (PT). Besides, the study used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques to analyze the data. Findings: This study confirms that factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, PT and customers’ DFL are significant determinants of street vendors’ intention to use QR code m-payment services. However, social influence and PI have shown an insignificant relationship with adopting a QR code m-payment system. Research limitations/implications: The results provide insights for policymakers and service providers. Specifically, government and bankers design promotional campaigns emphasizing the ease of use, perceived benefits, security and faster business transactions to accept and use the QR code m-payment system to encourage prospective users to achieve a cashless economy. Originality/value: Many prior studies have widely concentrated on m-payment adoption intention in India. However, only a few studies have attempted to examine the factors influencing the adoption of QR code m-payment services among merchants from emerging economies. There is a dearth of studies on QR code adoption from an unorganized sector perspective, specifically marginalized street vendors. Therefore, this study explicitly examines the extent to which the determinants of adoption intention toward QR code-based m-payment services among marginalized street vendors within the framework of the extended UTAUT model by incorporating DFL, PI and PT. The findings of this study contribute, theoretically and practically, to the existing literature. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, traditional payment methods such as cash, cheques, credit/debit cards, and bank transfers are commonly used for financial transactions across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, real estate, supply chain, gaming, music, finance, retail, agriculture, tourism, pharmaceuticals, and the education sector too. However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users. This initiative will positively contribute towards addressing the issues of financial transactions in the education sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

Our main objective is to highlight the extent to which existing models, often coming from related industries (such as telecom, payments, and banking) can be applied to study the effects of mobile money interoperability. We focus on four dimensions of interoperability. First, we consider mobile network interoperability (whether clients of one telecom can access another telecom's payment services) in connection with the IO literature on tying. Second, we discuss platform level interoperability (the ability to send money off-network) in light of the literature on compatibility. We also build on the behavioral IO literature to suggest how the effects of interoperability may be very heterogeneous across various types of firms and consumers, or even backfire. Third, we consider interoperability in the cash-in-cash-out agent network, in light of the literature on co-investment in network industries, and of more specific studies on ATMs' interoperability. Fourth, we discuss how the literature in banking and on data ownership can be used to understand interoperability of data. We conclude with some broader remarks on policy implications and on possible directions for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A global deluge of debit cards and prepaid cards - payment cards that do not require consumers to qualify for credit - is rapidly making electronic payment systems accessible to much of the world's population that previously paid in cash for goods and services. The global proliferation of payment cards is fraught with both risk and promise for consumers. The billions of people of low to moderate incomes who are being hurled from a cash economy into the era of electronic payments in emerging economies by the proliferation of debit and prepaid cards are particularly vulnerable to abuses by banks and merchants. Unregulated private lawmaking by payment card associations and card issuers will not ensure that consumers are treated fairly, due to their countervailing incentives to attract merchants into their payment networks. Technological solutions promote efficiency and limit abuse, but cannot ensure fair resolution of consumer-merchant disputes. Payment card associations such as Visa and MasterCard operate chargeback systems for resolving disputes, but chargeback systems cannot function in cash economies without merchants' consent, because cash transactions are usually anonymous, evidenced at most by a receipt, and do not involve an intermediary. However, while the lack of anonymity inherent in the use of payment cards entails risk for consumer privacy, it also makes possible greater transparency in payment systems. As billions of vulnerable consumers become connected to electronic payment systems, chargeback systems become a possible means of protecting them from merchant misconduct. Moreover, this lack of anonymity makes possible new ways of protecting consumers, such as disclosure to consumers of outcomes of the Visa and MasterCard chargeback systems through merchant ratings such as those posted on eBay. There is a risk that nations with emerging economies will uncritically emulate regimes of consumer protection adopted in the United States and Europe. These regimes in many respects lack a consistent conceptual foundation and fail to address problems, such as bank fees, access to banking services, and payment system insolvency, that are poorly addressed in developed countries if they are addressed at all. For example, debit and prepaid card transactions are both a convenient means of obtaining cash and a substitute for cash, but this does not justify denying chargeback rights to consumers who use debit and prepaid cards as if they had paid in cash. Prior scholarship on payment cards has suffered from the assumption that American use of credit cards is normative. This Article demonstrates that it is a global anomaly; most consumers worldwide use payment cards for convenience rather than a source of long-term credit, and that is why debit cards have become popular so quickly. Moreover, fees and charges imposed on consumers for payment card services are one of the most prolific sources of consumer complaints. Fee regulation should be regarded as a legitimate part of payments law in scholarship on the subject and should not be ignored in establishing a regulatory system to govern debit and prepaid cards.},

	abstract = {Many transit agencies in the United States plan to automate their fare collection and limit–or even eliminate–the use of cash fares, with the goals of expediting boarding, collecting data, and lowering costs. Yet about 10% of US adults lack a bank account or credit card, and many rely on restrictive cellphone data plans or do not have access to the internet or a smartphone. These riders will find it difficult to access transit in the future. This paper examines transit users’ experiences with fare technologies using a survey of riders in three cities. Our analysis reveals which riders are most at risk of being excluded, and how mitigation strategies could work to overcome barriers to cash-less transit. We find that a significant number of riders (∼30%) currently use cash on-board buses. If on-board cash fares were to be removed, a significant share of these riders appear able to switch to other options, though many imagine they will continue to use cash in some way (e.g. at retail or ticket vending machines); a small number claim they would no longer be able to ride transit if on-board cash fares were removed. Older and lower-income riders are more at risk of exclusion as they often lack access to smartphones or the internet. A significant number rely on less dependable internet sources, such as public Wi-Fi, potentially inhibiting some from using smartphone and internet-based payment systems. Findings suggest approaches to reduce the number of riders excluded from transit during fare technology adoption. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Perceptions of Austrian consumers regarding payment systems were assessed in a cross-sectional analysis applying social representations theory. Social representations help to unravel the sources of individuals' attitudinal or perceptual similarities and differences, which often stem from inter-group differences. In short, they are useful for the investigation of 'deeper structure' aspects of consumer behaviour, as has been shown in previous studies. This may be seen as a further step forward for marketing research, which operates largely on social phenomena. This study addresses the shortage of non-cognitive-based research in marketing by offering a methodological approach that uses triangulation on the basis of associative answers from social groups. A four-step analytic design revealed that consumer groups transpose the abstract concept of payment systems into tangible objects and processes in a similar way; however, their social background impacted which value was attached to established as well as new means of payment. Cash is still seen as the prototypical form of payment; newer forms, such as credit cards or ATM cards, appear already in the periphery of representations, urgently needing well-concerted marketing efforts to become recognized as substitutes for cash. From a managerial view, the research employs social phenomena as a basis for segmenting natural rather than nominal groups in order to better serve consumers' needs in an increasingly connected social reality. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), e-CNY, is currently in a large-scale pilot stage. In this study, a new monetarist model, both theoretically and quantitively, is developed to assess the relationship between the managed anonymity feature of e-CNY, social welfare, and taxation. The findings are as follows. First, the introduction of managed anonymous CBDC affects the official and shadow economy by increasing the diversity of payment instruments and suppressing tax evasion, thereby improving social welfare and government tax revenue. Second, if CBDC is ‘cash-like’ in the sense that it offers relatively high anonymity, then issuing CBDC meets the public demand for anonymous small value payment services and enhances the individual welfare of most households. Third, if CBDC is ‘deposit-like’ in the sense that it offers relatively low anonymity, then issuing CBDC combats illegal transactions in the shadow economy, and increases the total amount of social welfare and government tax revenue. The model, calibrated to the Chinese economy, suggests that aggregate welfare and government tax revenue can be increased by up to 3.2% and 10%, respectively. These findings suggest that policy-makers can dynamically adjust the anonymity design of CBDC to better align it with changing policy objectives and economic conditions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The Eurosystem is mandated to safeguard price stability according to article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Based on a theoretical and policy-oriented approach, this article sheds light on a second public good with enormous practical relevance both for financial markets and institutions as well as for the general public that the Eurosystem, and ultimately the European Central Bank (ECB), must safeguard according to article 128 TFEU: the availability of ideal monetary objects for the public. While monetary policy constitutes the instrument used to keep prices stable, the availability of ideal monetary objects is ensured through the issuance of 'cash' that serves as both money with selected properties and an anchor for other monies of the same currency, including sight deposits at commercial banks. Today, the role of ideal monetary objects is (still) primarily fulfilled by tangible banknotes. As the use of tangible banknotes declines, however, a digital equivalent and complement-a digital euro-becomes increasingly necessary. Accordingly, the article concludes that the ECB is both entitled and obliged de lege lata to issue a digital euro on the basis of article 128 TFEU. It further explains that neither tangible cash nor a digital euro can simultaneously be used as instruments in themselves to maintain price stability. © The Author(s) 2021.

Micropayment systems tend to collect 15 percent of the amount transferred, but with no minimum charge, thus they can support small sales like 25 or 50 cents, which other payment systems cannot handle. It is noted that when buying telephone service for example, people frequently buy unlimited monthly service even if per-call service would be cheaper. The hope is that small or non-existent minimum charges will make it practical to sell things online for a few cents, implying that micropayments are going to be the technology of the future.},

	abstract = {A common feature of practically all strands of post-Keynesian theory is the notion that the money supply should not be considered as fixed independently of money demand in macroeconomic models. There are, however, at least two ways to postulate money endogeneity. The first, and perhaps best known today, is Kaldor’s version, where the money supply curve is assumed to be horizontal at a given interest rate level. Kaldor’s approach focuses on the means-of-payment function of money, stating that money is created when firms and individuals plan to acquire goods and services and borrow from banks the necessary amount of money to do it. Kaldor’s emphasis is laid on central banks’ behavior, assumed to be entirely accommodating of commercial banks’ demands for the reserves required to satisfy the demand for bank loans. Keynes’s version, based on his Treatise on Money and other essays, focuses on money in its liquid-store-of-wealth function. To propose that money is the most liquid asset in an entrepreneurial economy rules out the possibility of accepting a horizontal money supply curve, as it is shown in the paper. In fact, the first and most important contrasting concept in Keynes’s approach in comparison to Kaldor’s is the notion of liquidity. Keynes proposes a hierarchical view of liquidity, while Kaldorviews liquidity as a ‘flat’ concept, where different assets exhibit different degrees of liquiditybut their relationship is not hierarchical. A second contrast is that Keynes’s view of endogeneity is based on a theory of how banks work instead of a theory of central banking. The paper develops Keynes’s approach to money endogeneity along the lines just described and evaluates Kaldor’s criticisms of Keynes’s views. © 2013 The Author.},

Using a model, we highlight that setting the conditions of payment is an endogenous part of a takeover agreement between the acquirer and the target. Our contribution is to show how, in the acquisition process, the setting of the cash percentage is a key element for conveying private information on the gains of synergy and the gains that result from the transaction. In our model, we internalize asymmetries of information and possible exaggeration biases. Both will influence the joint setting of a mixed payment scheme. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

So far, most of the proposed blind signature schemes are based on the difficulty of solving the factoring problem and quadratic residues. In this paper, the authors intend to propose two new untraceable blind signature schemes based on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.

	abstract = {Pay-on-entry (POE) fare control for on-street transit allows effective revenue protection. However, the POE systems requires single door boarding and therefore increased stop dwell times compared with proofof- payment (POP) systems. Most light rail transit (LRT) uses POP but is often criticized for poor revenue protection. This paper explores the trade-offs between the POE and POP systems through the comprehensive modeling of revenue protection, dwell time, ridership, revenue, and operational resource impacts in a case study of the conversion of the Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, POP system to a POE system; the paper uses data from LRT in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which uses a POE system. The results show that the POE system increases journey times (+15%) and decreases ridership (-10%) and that 49 (+14%) additional light rail vehicles are required. POE conversion costs a net 29.4 million Australian dollars (A$) per annum and A$276 million for new vehicles, compared with a fare evasion reduction of A$8.1 million per annum. A 30-year discount cash flow analysis of the POE system results in a benefit-cost ratio of 0.44. The results are most sensitive to POE stop dwell time but not to fare evasion rates. Stop dwell times have a significant impact on LRT financial performance; alternative methods of revenue protection, such as increased inspection rates, are more effective than the POE system. The results justify the widespread adoption of POP systems in LRT and should provide a strong basis for defending against criticisms of the higher fare evasion rates of POP systems. The results should also act as a wake-up call to any LRT (or bus) system that still uses a POE rather than POP system and provide a basis for assessing the impacts of POP conversion for all modes.

In this statement, Keynes outlines the functions of financial systems in Entrepreneurial Economies, the type of economies he hypothesizes we live in. In entrepreneurial economies, investing firms have to be able to get hold of the necessary amount of means of payment required to purchase or order investment goods and to build balance sheets where in- and outflows of cash are broadly matched within reasonable margins of safety. This means that financial systems’ primary role in Keynesian economics is not to allocate savings or capital but to allocate liquidity and to allow investors to build liquid balance sheets.

Using payment system reforms in Eastern European countries over the 1995-2005 period as a natural experiment, we find evidence that payments reforms were an important precondition for the credit boom observed in our sample countries. We also find that payment system reforms led to a shift away from cash (outside money) and towards demand deposits (inside money) as a medium of exchange and that this in turn enabled an expansion of credit in the sample countries. These findings have important implications for our understanding of financial intermediation, highlighting the nexus between banks' role as providers of payment services and as providers of credit. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Financial barriers are a major obstacle to accessing maternal health care services in low-resource settings. In Madagascar, less than half of live births are attended by skilled health staff. Although mobile money-based savings and payment systems are often used to pay for a variety of services, including health care, data on the implications of a dedicated mobile money wallet restricted to health-related spending during pregnancy–a mobile health wallet (MHW)–are not well understood. In cooperation with the Madagascan Ministry of Health, this study aims to elicit the perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of key stakeholders in relation to a MHW amid a pilot study in 31 state-funded health care facilities. We conducted a two-stage qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews with stakeholders (N = 21) representing the following groups: community representatives, health care providers, health officials and representatives from phone provider companies. Interviews were conducted in Atsimondrano and Renivohitra districts, between November and December of 2017. Data was coded thematically using inductive and deductive approaches, and found to align with a social ecological model. Key facilitators for successful implementation of the MHW, include (i) close collaboration with existing communal structures and (ii) creation of an incentive scheme to reward pregnant women to save. Key barriers to the application of the MHW in the study zone include (i) disruption of informal benefits for health care providers related to the current cash-based payment system, (ii) low mobile phone ownership, (iii) illiteracy among the target population, and (iv) failure of the MHW to overcome essential access barriers towards institutional health care services such as fear of unpredictable expenses. The MHW was perceived as a potential solution to reduce disparities in access to maternal health care. To ensure success of the MHW, direct demand-side and provider-side financial incentives merit consideration. © 2020 Muller et al.

	abstract = {The post-demonetization phase in India has triggered more cashless transactions; a shortage of cash in the system had forced consumers to shift themselves from cash to cashless transactions. In the retail space, the thrust has shifted on costs, as banks continued their efforts towards migrating customers to lower-cost electronic and automated channels to reduce human intervention. On the contrary, it is also vital to check the customers’ demographic impact on the usage of digital payment services. The objective of the study is to analyse the changing customer dynamics and improve the customer experience from the outcome. This article aims to investigate the impact of demographic factors on consumer usage (CU) of Digital payments during post-demonetization. Further, exploring the impact of demographic factors (gender, age, education, marital status and income) on CU and satisfaction of 599 respondents towards various digital payment methods in tier I and tier II cities of India. The results show a significant impact of age, education, occupation, and income of respondents and no significant impact of gender and marital status of the respondents on consumers’ usage. The outcomes of the current work revealed useful insights into consumer’s usage and satisfaction with four prevailing digital payment methods vis-à-vis demographic factors. This study is significant as it empirically examines the impact of demographic factors on the CU of digital payment systems during the post-demonetization period in India. © 2021 Fortune Institute of International Business.},

Cash payment systems are very different from digital payments because they no longer use banks as intermediaries for transactions. The scope of this study is to determine the differences that take place with purchasing decisions using digital payment systems with OVO Indonesia smart applications. By using the paired T-test sample test method and testing the regression class assumptions, it is expected we will document the comparison between cash and digital payment systems as regards changes in consumers’ buying interest behavior towards goods. Data is obtained by purposive sampling using special characteristics for smart application users. The results show that digital payments are developing very quickly, but cash payments still dominate due to the unavailability of complete facilities and infrastructure to support digital payment systems other than in cities. This study illustrates that digital payments have not been able to completely change consumer buying behavior in large numbers, but the main finding in this study is an increase in the percentage of digital payment usage to the online market, due to the many conveniences provided in OVO smart applications. © xx xx},

Traditionally, they provided a highly effective mechanism for administering, collecting and delivering cash and helped to promote an extensive range of associated lending and ancillary services. However, the import-? ance of branch networks is only tenable provided that the conditions which determined their historical position continue to apply. The most important of these conditions are that the market continues to respond to it and that it will remain the basis for existing and emerging patterns of competitive behaviour. With this consideration in mind and against a background of unprecedented change in the financial services markets, the article attempts to assess the future validity of branch networks by obtaining the opinions of customers on a range of important issues currently confronting banking institutions with comprehensive branch networks. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

	abstract = {Very little is known about payment choices in the African context and in developing countries in general. Their unique infrastructures and economic nuances suggest that both the availability of instruments and supporting structures in the payment system are different from the general perception. This exploratory study investigates the payment choices in Zimbabwe, a country that claims the existence of a near cashless society. Through a descriptive and logit analysis based on survey data, we find that a strong preference for cash, coupled with cash shortages and inadequate infrastructure for electronic payments, has resulted in a multitiered pricing system, with significant premiums for digital payments. This perverse effect counters the heavily lauded benefits of mobile payments in developing countries. We argue that the demand-side bias in government policies will not effectively counter persistent currency failures and the resultant inflation, both of which have a strong influence on payment choices. We recommend that the government should consider polices that will reduce merchant adoption costs to encourage widespread use of digital payment instruments, such as debit cards. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose P2PM-pay scheme which provides two key points. The first key point is related with the mobile cash. In P2PM-pay scheme, the mobile cash is controlled by the expiration date. The expiration date is embedded into the mobile cash by partial blind signature during the withdrawal date, and the bank does not hold information about the operation. Moreover, we have considered the effective date and deposit date for administrative purposes. The effective date is when customers use their mobile cash to pay for products, and the deposit date is when merchants receive the funds in their bank account. The other key point is related with the authentication process among participants. Although P2PM-pay uses WTLS protocol, we propose a wireless public key infrastructure with an efficient certificate path validation. Furthermore, the design of the proposed scheme achieves successfully the security requirements described in previous works. Consequently, P2PM-pay is secure against well-known attacks and efficient in terms of processing time. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The decision to demonetize was followed by a large-scale push for adoption of digital payments. Behavioral changes during such shocks do have specific nuances different from those during normal times. Using the concept of resilience, we examine the drivers of behavior change that differentiated those that were able to make the switch compared to those that weren't. Those technologically more adept were more resilient to the shock, in terms of being able to navigate through new means of exchange. Also, rural poor showed greater resilience than urban poor, a function of the level of homogeneity in those societies with respect to technology adoption and the ability to cope without changing cash practices. We also found that those who had bank accounts and relied largely on those accounts for daily transactions, without being aware of alternate modes, were impacted the most. From a policy perspective this research cautions against unintended consequences of purely access-driven incentives to behavior change, advocating instead a holistic approach. © 2019 ACM.},

However, whether mobile payment influences consumers’ choices between hedonic and utilitarian products, an important question in the field of consumer well-being research, has not been fully investigated. To address this research gap, the authors examine the influence of mobile payment and traditional payment methods (e.g., cash payment, card payment) on consumers’ preferences for hedonic products. They find that mobile payment triggers consumers’ hedonic mindset, which increases consumers’ preferences for hedonic products. The effect is moderated by mobile device type such that the effect is weaker for smart wearable (vs. mobile phone) payment because smart wearable devices are less associated with a hedonic mindset. This study offers novel insight into the effect of high technologies in payment systems, specifically mobile payment, on consumer well-being and calls for more investigation of the effects of mobile payment. © American Marketing Association 2023.},

In the era of the internet, individuals often make payments through various financial platforms such as mobile payments, bank's online interfaces, etc. This paper presents an analysis of a large person-to-person (P2P) financial transactional network of three Baltic countries, namely Estonia, Latvia and, Lithuania. We collaborated with one of the largest financial institutions operating in these three countries to analyse an anonymous dataset of more than two million customers. We modeled these transactions from network science and explored the data with four different objectives. The first objective was to explore the network of transactions from a structural perspective and interpret their meanings. The next two objectives included the attributes of the nodes. In the second objective, we analysed the network for the similarity of interacting nodes in terms of income level. In the third objective, we analysed the spending pattern similarity among the interacting customers. The fourth objective aimed at exploring the relation between income and spending patterns. Our results indicate that the online payment network of Estonia is the most intact, among all the three countries, confirming the slogan of e-Estonia and Lithuanian network being the most fragmented. In addition, Latvia and Lithuania are more similar to each other in terms of their income vs. similarity patterns compared to Estonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that has studied such a large P2P financial network across three countries and the results of this study can provide insight into the financial behavior of the three Baltic countries. © 2019 IEEE.},

Any transaction is done through the SMS where the users of the system need to type the specific codes or commands for the transaction that they want to make. The commands require the user to type the PIN number (which is converted as hidden and encrypted text) and TAC (Transaction Authentication Code) for security purposes. Different transactions will have different commands that are sent to Malaysian Electronic Payment System (MEPS). These commands are then sent to respective banks through the encrypted channel. The components that are needed to enable this system are any kind of mobile phone that supports SMS system, encrypted communication channel and the banking system. This system makes transactions easier the users as neither cash nor credit cards are required for any transaction. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Following success in Latin America, cash transfers are rapidly gaining currency as a principal tool for social protection in Africa. Pilot projects abound, but are often conceived and evaluated without much attention to the political and social implications of targeting, of payment systems, and of introducing cash into poor communities. These implications can be profound, and must be considered in designing cash transfer programmes. Using examples from Oxford Policy Management's evaluation and design work in Kenya, we discuss effects on the political and social fabric of in particular (1) targeting, (2) payments systems and (3) the overall process of cash transfers. First, who is targeted, how and who targets can radically alter local power relations, and this can have national consequences. Targeting divides communities into recipients and non-recipients, and this has consequences for social relations. Second, different payment systems create different requirements for civil registration, possibilities for fraud and opportunities for connectedness. These requirements and opportunities all have potential to change citizens' relationship with the State with far-reaching political implications. Finally, because of these effects, implementing a system of cash transfers (even a pilot project) is not an apolitical policy intervention and in fact will influence quite profoundly relationships between individuals within households, within communities and within the broader polity. This has an effect on the development direction of the country in question. We ask whether this should be the donors' role, and suggest greater engagement with national and local political actors in planning, designing and implementing cash transfer programmes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

As societies move toward cashless payment for many goods, the question arises of how emerging payment technologies might impact gambling-related harms. We performed a scoping review following PRISMA guidelines to identify research testing the effects of monetary format in gambling. Our eligibility criteria focused on controlled experimental manipulations, to best establish the causal impact of monetary format. We sought to characterize different types of monetary manipulations that have been studied in a gambling context. We identified 19 eligible articles, comprising 23 individual experiments. These experiments were organized according to four distinct manipulations. The most common design (12 experiments), compared gambling under the presence or absence of money. Smaller numbers of experiments were identified manipulating monetary salience, testing Responsible Gambling tools, and testing the impact of promotional inducements. We identified no studies that compared gambling using cash against digital payment forms. Our review highlights a paucity of research testing the possible impact of digital and cashless payment options on gambling related harms, using experimental designs that would permit causal conclusions to be drawn. © 2022 The Author(s).

In general, fair payment protocols require the continuous availability of an external trusted third party (TTP), a dedicated site which is trusted by both participants. In this paper we present solutions to the fair exchange problem in mobile environments, where customers frequently disconnect from the network and thus continuous availability of the external TTP is not given. Our approach utilizes smart card on the customer's side partly taking over the duties of the TTP. A novel digital cash protocol is also proposed. In the protocol we implement a distributed anonymity provider agent with smart card on the customer's side. Thus accountable anonymity is guaranteed. Compared with Chaum 's and Wang's schemes its communication cost and customer 's computation are more reduced. The proposed digital cash are proved to be unreusable, unexpandable, untraceable, and unforgeable. © 2006 IEEE.},

This study also explores the challenges of electronic payments from a security perspective, in particular, and provides preliminary security countermeasures for each of the issues discussed. Beside that, the study also discusses further on the prospects of electronic payment systems. It is essential to put in place an integrated, overall risk-management approach to security, including independent security assessments as one of the components in the use of electronic payment products. © 2009, IGI Global.

	abstract = {E-Money mobile payments, also called digital money, are electronic payments, payment transactions using an Internet network integrated with NFC-enabled smartphones and prepaid cards. In Indonesia not only banks that issue e-money products, telecom operators from Telkomsel also issued an e-money product called T-cash. T-cash is a new innovation of electronic money presented by Telkomsel. The purpose of this study was to check the effect of responsiveness, smartness, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence, and security against the intention to use T-cash. The data used in this study include primary and secondary data. Respondents in this study are users of T-cash products in Yogyakarta as many as 115 respondents. While the data were collected by using the questionnaire to then be analyzed using the amos analysis technique 22.0. The results of the analysis prove that two characteristics of technology, responsiveness and smartness have a significant effect on perceived usefulness. Ease of use has a significant effect on perceived usefulness. Ease of use, usefulness and security have a significant effect on intention to use. The higher the level of responsiveness, smartness, ease of use, perceived usefulness and security will also increase the use of T-cash social influence factors have no effect on intention to use. © 2019 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.

Card payment is more costly than cash payment, so the seller prefers that the buyer pays cash. In this article, we study the strategy of the seller setting a convenient price, which simplifies transactions and pushes the buyer to pay cash. The theoretical analysis, which models both the seller and the buyer in a game setting, derives two propositions: (1) the seller is more likely to set a more convenient price and (2) the buyer is more likely to pay cash a more convenient price. The empirical analysis supports both propositions. Thus, sellers adopt a convenience pricing strategy – prices for cash – and this strategy pushes buyers to pay cash – cash for prices. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

However, there has been little attention paid to the security requirements for practical off-line E-cash system based on IC Card including entity authentication, key management, implementation of cryptographic algorithm, etc. Thus, this paper describes the security requirements for cryptographic algorithms, integrity for implementation of cryptographic algorithm, authentication module, key management, and E-cash protocols. © 2005 IEEE.},

Coins are withdrawn if, and only if payer's account is debited. Change is returned to an anonymous payer, who gets it always but only if she is entitled to receive it. Wiretapping of even all channels does not yield a valid coin, and a payment can not he deposited at the account of another payee.

	abstract = {A new form of mobile payment, Quick Response (QR) code, has been a popular way of paying bus fares in China since 2017. Compared with conventional payment methods, cash or IC card, QR code shows a lot of differences in response time, recognition accuracy, and payment procedure, which significantly influences the boarding service time (BST) for passengers. However, no research has considered its efficiency. This study, therefore, tries to fill this gap and investigate its influence on BST. Sufficient ride-check data were collected, and the influence of the QR code payment method on BST was examined through a set of regression models. Passengers pay the bus fare with different payment methods as their first choice; nevertheless, when the payment fails, they may transfer among them. According to the payment choice, result, and process, we introduce the first-choice-based, the last-choice-based, and the choice-transfer-based models, respectively. The scenario with delays in calling out the QR code was considered in the choice-transfer-based model. The onboard crowdedness was regarded as a categorical variable to determine the regime of the boarding process in all models. We conduct empirical analysis in Wuhan, and this study can help to identify the influence of the QR code payment method on BST, consequently, improving bus service efficiency.  © 2020 Guojun Chen et al.},

This announcement and the new dawn of the 5G mobile technology show India's intent to lead the world in the Digital Revolution. This research paper seeks to study the various aspects of this announcement from an economic and financial perspective. The researchers have detailed the various possible benefits and risks of this decision based on the limited information provided by the government on the design of the central bank digital currency (CBDC). In particular, they have discussed the cybersecurity risks, such as hacking and government surveillance, and have suggested possible cryptography solutions like hashing and tokenization. The decision also means expanding the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from being just a central bank to providing payment services. The most important design characteristic of the Digital Rupee is its levy of interest. The paper discusses the cases of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing Digital Rupee, along with their potential economic and monetary policy implications. The researchers have showcased various existing mathematical/ FinTech models for predicting the impact of CBDCs on the banking sector. They have commented that the short-term possibility of replacing cash with the Digital Rupee is non-existent due to the enormous volume of cash transactions in the Indian economy, whereas the long-term probability is much brighter. They have also compiled the country-specific challenges in implementing the CBDC, such as the population's lack of financial literacy and the country's weak technological infrastructure.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, the Internet and the World Wide Web on-line business is booming, with traffic, advertising and content growing at sustained exponential rates. However, the full potential of on-line commerce has not been possible to realize due to the lack of convenient and secure electronic payment methods (e.g., for buying e-goods and paying with e-money). Although it became clear very early that it is vital for payments to be safe and efficient, and to avoid requiring complicated user intervention, it is still the case that the Internet payment method of choice today is that of traditional credit cards. Despite their widespread use and market penetration, these have a number of significant limitations and shortcomings, including lack of security, lack of anonymity, inability to reach all audiences due to credit requirements, large overhead with respect to payments, and the related inefficiency in processing small payment amounts. These limitations (some of which are present in the real world) prompted the design of alternative electronic payment systems very early in the Internet age - even before the conception of the World Wide Web. Such designs promised the security, anonymity, efficiency, and universal appeal of cash transactions, but in an electronic form. Some early schemes, such as the one proposed by First Virtual, were built around the credit card structure; others, such as the scheme developed by DigiCash, offered a solution with cryptographic security and payer anonymity. Still others, such as Millicent, introduced micropayment solutions. However, none of these systems managed to proliferate in the marketplace, and most have either ceased to exist or have only reached a limited audience. This paper is associated with a panel discussion whose purpose is to address the reasons why the international e-commerce market has rejected proposed solutions, and to suggest new ways for electronic payments to be used over the Internet, avoiding the problems inherent in credit card transactions. The purpose of this paper is to set the stage for such a discussion by presenting, in brief, some of the payment schemes currently available and to discuss some of the basic problems in the area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

A total of 250 papers were chosen as a part of this study to conduct SLR and bibliometric analysis, out of which 62 relevant papers, published in 48 peer reviewed and open access journals, were taken for the final analysis. VOSviewer is used to carry out the bibliometric analysis. The bibliometric coupling helped in identifying three clusters: factors influencing m-payment adoption, consumer’s attitude towards m-payments and the effect of technological and behavioural factors on the adoption of m-payments. This study would help future researchers in gaining significant insights on the current status of the existing literature and assist in conducting a qualitative literature review. © 2022 MDI.},

In this paper, a novel secure and convenient E-cash payment scheme is proposed based on analyzing the present technology of E-cash. This scheme is composed of three protocols, which are withdrawal protocol, payment protocol and deposit protocol. Utilizing the property of the modulus operation, this scheme could meet the demand of E-cash with only few public keys, and solve the problem of payment change by using blind signature and direct signature. At last, a prototype system is realized. The experiment result shows that proposed E-cash system is feasible. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of mobile phones to make payments is already a wide-spreading reality. While some mobile payment solutions achieved a considerable success and are already in use, others failed in the pilot phase. Nevertheless, there is an area where mobile payments have been quite successful: mobile ticketing in public transport. In fact, there are several advantages of mobile ticketing over traditional ticketing systems, such as queue avoidance, ubiquitous and remote access to payment, and the lack of need to carry coins and cash. This paper intends to propose a mobile payment system to be implemented in the Public Transport of Metropolitan Area of Oporto. After defining the payment ticketing model, a prototype was developed and tested by a sample of users. These tests allowed gathering some feedback about the feasibility of the system as well as useful insights about the concept, new in public transport in Portugal. The findings attained so far suggest that users considered the system extremely useful, since it is more convenient than traditional systems, improving the travelling process and experience. It was also clear that users valued the integration of additional and complementary services with mobile payments, such as real-time traffic information, maps and schedules. There are also several barriers to the adoption of such a system elicited by users, such as premium price, complex interfaces and perceived risks, such as security and privacy concerns. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

It tries to keep track of the purchasing-behavior of a customer by recording customer’s purchase information, including his credit card number, as a key identifier to the customer. While it may benefit the customer, the drawback is that the privacy of the customer is intruded. If the customer is using an anonymous payment system such as electronic cash / digital coins, his privacy is protected, but he will not get any benefit from the loyalty program which tries to record his payment information. This paper suggests several solutions to solve merchant’s need to gather statistical data from customer’s purchasing behavior versus customer’s need for privacy. Among the solutions, we present the idea of blindly signed pseudo digital certificates, which satisfies our requirement for a loyalty program scheme with an anonymous payment system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

Using India as a case study, this article documents how supply-side actors (political, economic, financial and technological) used the pandemic to generate a new public consensus about digital payments. The article argues that these actors framed the agenda to draw public attention on cash and digital payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, that this new consensus extended and deviated from narratives created during the Digital India (2015) and demonetisation (2016) debates, and that trade bodies and businesses unrelated to banking, finance and technology were active in setting this new agenda. Agenda-setting in the pandemic era continues to mould the payments trajectory in both India and elsewhere. In India, we argue, it has challenged aspects of cash that previously elicited trust: its materiality and associated social interaction. Consequently, older agendas have been promoted, and digital (and especially contactless) payments have assumed a new level of importance to economic life in India. © 2022 Asian Studies Association of Australia.},

Based on a sample of retailers in three metropolitan areas of China, this paper finds the combined market shares of Alipay and WeChat fall in the region of 55–65 per cent in various payment scenarios, both at the point-of-sale and online, thus confirming the dominance of non-bank payment service providers in these areas.

The other distinguished feature is that the proposed system achieves the anonymity against the commercial banks, while enabling the central bank to support user tracing and double-spending prevention. Specifically, by utilizing the BBS+ signatures, the users can create bank accounts, withdraw coins, and deposit the received coins at the commercial banks without exposing their real identities. As a trusted party, the central bank is responsible for money issuing and financial regulation. In addition, to ensure the system inclusive, users can receive payments from others even they do not have bank accounts at commercial banks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system achieves the desirable properties of balance, anonymity, and traceability and show the efficiency and practicality for the implementation on mobile devices. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agriculture in Bangladesh is susceptible to numerous climatic hazards, especially flooding. Smallholder farmers in the country have been losing agricultural productions to flooding because they lack flood insurance for decades. Several studies that used the contingent valuation method (CVM) to investigate farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance demand through monetary payment mode reported that small farmers suffer considerable financial constraints that limit their ability to pay insurance premiums. To avoid this concern, present study designed a novel econometric approach to assessing the validity and reliability of non-monetary WTP estimates in the context of environmental valuation research. By comparing monetary and non-monetary payment systems using the CV method, the study offers non-monetary flood insurance options for Bangladeshi smallholder farmers. For this purpose, 600 farmers in four flood-prone districts of northern Bangladesh were interviewed about their preferences for a hypothetical flood insurance market. To assess the accuracy and precision of non-monetary WTP estimates, a multivariate regression model was used. The results show that farmers with lower incomes favored non-monetary payment choices, and approximately 26% of the overall sample opted to contribute a portion of their seasonal rice crop rather than cash to cover the cost of flood insurance. Regression results show that farmers’ in-kind WTP decisions were influenced by a variety of factors, including farmland elevation, frequency of flood returns, non-farm income, and commercialization in agricultural farming, demonstrating the validity and consistency of the non-monetary payment alternative. Findings imply that subsidy policies are insufficient to expand the adoption of non-monetary flood insurance market in Bangladesh. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

However, there are as many points urging caution. In this context, the purpose of the present paper is to analyse the specificity of the potential digital euro as part of the international payments’ architecture. The European Central Bank (ECB) is focusing on the digital euro project, running the investigation phase until October 2023. The debate on the digital euro adoption is in line with the international one, but there are several distinctive aspects. Various scenarios are taken into account, starting from general principles for retail CBDCs, results of the public consultation of a digital euro, experts’ opinions regarding privacy, security, usability, costs, offline use, acceptance, potential disintermediation, standards and international implications of the digital euro. The research also outlines the relations between major actors involved, while identifying the prerequisites for a swift functioning of the Eurozone payment system with digital euro at its core. © 2022},

This research analyzes the success factors in the adoption by customers of Bizum, a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment system widely used in Spain. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) model and includes the analysis of the moderating effect of perceived risk and the mediating effect of perceived trust. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the proposed objectives, an online questionnaire was administered to 701 Spanish smartphone users, potential users of the proposed P2P payment systems. Findings: The results show that perceived usefulness is the most important predictor of intention to use. Additionally, a medium predictive relevance performance of the proposed model is found. Originality/value: This research contributes to a more holistic understanding of the adoption of P2P payment systems and provides new business opportunities that companies can exploit through the use of this technology. © 2023, Ana Irimia-Diéguez, Francisco Liébana-Cabanillas, Antonio Blanco-Oliver and Juan Lara-Rubio.},

	abstract = {Atomicity and fault tolerance issues are important and typically open questions for implementing a complete payment scheme. The notion of "fair off-line e-cash" (FOLC) was originally suggested as a tool for crime prevention. This paper shows that FOLC schemes not just enable better control of e-cash when things go wrong due to "criminal suspicion" and other "regulatory/legal" issues, but it can also assure atomicity which takes care of conservation of money in case of failures during transaction runtime. The added protocols are very efficient and quite simple to implement. This kind of piggybacking atomicity control over "anonymity revocation" makes good sense as both actions are done by off-line invocation of the same trustees (TTPs). The resulting solution is a comprehensive yet efficient solution to money conservation in electronic cash transactions based on FOLC schemes. The adopted recovery approach makes the involved participants (customer, bank, merchant) sure that they can \re-think" the transactions when things go wrong, implying the atomicity of the transactions. We also take an optimistic approach achieving fair exchange costing only 2-round of communicational complexity (trivially the lower bound) with no additional TTP involvement since FOLC already employs such a party. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},

Some prominent examples include Google's Wallet, WeChat Pay, and Apple Pay. Most of these technologies, however, are designed for users to be able to pay conveniently to the business. In other words, they are designed with the business to user model in mind. Besides, an active network connection with an external payment server is required either from payer or payee during transaction. Our work intends to supplement existing solutions, which allows payment to be made in an off-line and dual-anonymous manner. In doing so, a dual-anonymous off-line electronic cash scheme is proposed by utilizing BBS+ signature. The feature of our scheme is dual-anonymous payment, which means that both the payer and the payee in any transaction cannot be identified even all other users and the payment server collude. Through security proof and performance analysis, we also demonstrate that the security of the proposed scheme can be reduced to standard assumptions and it is suitable for applications in mobile commerce.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

Toll plazas in India have a colossal rush and are always questionable for their service and the actual amount of payment collection. To avoid the hustle and cash payment in the current situation, go for the e-payment system. This will really help to avoid carrying cash amount as well change of money. But the constraints are required internet for the execution of e payment system. In this system, we need trend people, standard procedures for the payment system, and enhanced technologies. An entire financial exchange is based on a bank and its network link. But the bank has a centralized system, and sometimes it is not secure. This research work proposed the toll payment system based on blockchain to provide a safer and manageable system. As the blockchain feature, this proposed model is secure and least chance to temple the data. In the working process of this system, we use mobile to read QR codes at the toll plaza for the payment. The system uses a smart contract to pay as per the traveling distance covered by the vehicle, and every toll system has a record of these transactions.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This article seeks to state the peculiar place held in it by James Steuart when, in the XVIIIth century, cash payments and partial money keep on ruling. Among the very first he investigates the consequences resulting from the development of a money of credit conceived as a complete one and he underlines the necessity of an imperative stability for the banking system. The first part examines why, with the aim of curbing hoardings and the spoliation of lenders associated with a nominalist approach of the unit of account, he defends the generalization of a banking currency mingled with a stable money of account. The second part studies how, with the "bankarization" of money creation, Steuart succeeds in showing the importance, as unit of account and standard of payments, of the numéraire chosen for the lending contracts of the banking system.A system which stability agents are confident with because prudential rules, regulation and supervision are considered as efficient.

	abstract = {Over the last decades, there has been a proliferation of cash transfer programmes across the global South. Digital technologies have given this seeming countermovement a boost by promising to instantaneously transfer cash from the coffers of development agencies and national governments to the pockets of the poor, sidestepping the neo-patrimonial state. With the COVID-19 crisis, tech billionaires have teamed up with development institutions to fast-track ‘digital payment ecosystems’ under the guise of financial inclusion and fiscal savings. Much has been written about how such initiatives accelerate the financialization of social welfare and collateralization of the poor by trapping cash transfer recipients in relations of credit and debt. Less has been written about grassroots strategies to claw back power from digital control. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Mozambique, this article explores three sites of contention at the interface of digital technologies and cash transfer administration: the development of an information management system, the application of a proxy means test and the outsourcing of cash transfer payments to private providers. While not always successful, the article concludes, counter-hegemonic repertoires of action are critical to shaping the terms of cash transfer administration amidst a global ‘war of position’ in policy making. © 2021 International Institute of Social Studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Consumers in the Netherlands made more than 3.2 billion debit card transactions at points-of-sale in 2015, corresponding to over half of all point-of-sale payments in that year. This study provides insights into the environmental impact of debit card transactions based on a life cycle assessment (LCA). In addition, it identifies several areas within the debit card payment chain where the environmental impact can be reduced. Methods: The debit card payment system can be divided into three subsystems: debit cards, payment terminals, and data centers used for transaction processing. Input data for all elements within each subsystem (manufacturing, transport, energy use, and disposal) were retrieved from interviews and literature study. Seven key companies and authorities within the debit card system such as the Dutch Payments Association, two banks, two data centers, one payment terminal producer and a recycling company contributed data. The analysis is conducted using SimaPro, the Ecoinvent 3.0 database and the ReCiPe endpoint (H) impact assessment method. Results and discussion: One Dutch debit card transaction in 2015 is estimated to have an absolute environmental impact of 470 μPt. Within the process chain of a debit card transaction, the relative environmental impact of payment terminals is dominant, contributing 75% of the total impact. Terminal materials (37%) and terminal energy use (27%) are the largest contributors to this share, while the remaining impact comprises data center (11%) and debit card (15%) subsystems. For data centers, this impact mainly stems from their energy use. Finally, scenario analyses show that a significant decrease (44%) in the environmental impact of the entire debit card payment system could be achieved by stimulating the use of renewable energy in payment terminals and data centers, reducing the standby time of payment terminals and increasing the lifetimes of debit cards. Conclusions: For the first time, the environmental consequences of electronic card payment systems are evaluated. The total environmental impact of debit card transactions in the Netherlands is relatively modest compared to the impact of cash payments, which are the closest substitute of debit card payments at the point-of-sale. Scenario analysis indicates that the environmental impact can be reduced by 44%. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {Performance measurement is an important component of lean-based management systems, however cost management systems or analysis have largely been applied at a high level and have not attempted to measure or model the production cost impacts of disruption on a lean project. While it is important to develop systems for practical site management, it is equally important to ensure that such systems can accommodate mainstream performance measurement systems. In this paper, the performance system known as Earned Value Analysis is adapted to a location-based method for planning and controlling work known as flowline or line-of-balance. The resultant method for forecasting cash flow, modeling the costs of interference and controlling costs, is described. The method is compatible with location-based scheduling methods. It uses location-based quantities and their unit prices as starting data. Because the location-based quantities are also used in developing the flowline schedule, the start and finish date for each quantity is also known. This information can be used to calculate cash flow more accurately than previously. In the preplanning phase, quantity estimates and estimated prices are used to create a location-based cost estimate. During the production phase, more accurate quantity data is available and prices from contracts can be used directly to arrive at a first cost forecast, before commencing the work. When the work is being done, cost controlling can be done by surveying the actual quantities of each location. The cost forecast is then updated based on these actual quantities and using the contract prices. The location-based schedule forecast can be used to forecast overhead costs and to forecast costs of interference. The paper contributes to our understanding of monitoring and control in a flowline-based management system in a lean-construction methodology. It also demonstrates that effective locationbased control of the payment system allows better management of sub-contractors during production.},

Thus. how to design a practical and reliable payment system becomes a significant issue. However most payment systems including electronic credit card. electronk cash and electronic check, have the dradlock problem on transachons. To solve this problem, the previous payment systems focus on the way of transacting synchronously online. Nevertheless, this solution is not efficient. In this paper we propose an efficient payment system by using electronic bill of lading. Compared with other payment systems. the proposed scheme can solve the dradlock prohlrm without synchronized transaction online. In addition, this scheme is constructed with simplicity. only using several hash functions and one modular-riponentiation computation, which makes it efficient and practical. Moreover the proposed scheme provides a new method of payment in r-commrrce. © 2010 ISSN.},

As evidence from the last 30 years shows, demand for cash increases during periods of crisis, regardless of the nature of the crisis. The nature of the crisis does, however, determine whether small or large banknote denominations are affected more. This study finds that times of payment uncertainties are associated with increased demand for small denominations, probably reflecting an elevated demand for transaction balances. By contrast, in times of financial crisis or general economic uncertainty, the increased demand for cash is largely the result of consumers taking precautionary actions and building up non-transaction balances; for this reason, there is greater demand for large banknote denominations. This study finds that cash continues to play an important role in crisis management.Whether this function can also be fulfilled by a future central bank digital currency, however, remains to be seen. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Construction companies require meticulous and thorough financial planning to ensure business survival in an increasingly competitive global market. Past studies assert that cash flow management is also crucial to meeting project and organisational performance expectations. However, the link between an advance payment system (APS), cash flow and project performance has hitherto received scant academic attention. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attributes and impact of APS on cash flow, project and organisational performance. This study surveyed all registered contractors listed in Grades 1–9 on the Construction Industry Development Board Register of Contractors in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted an empirical epistemological design and deductive reasoning to analyse primary data collated via a questionnaire data collection instrument. Summary statistical and regression analysis were used to explore data garnered. Findings: This study found that key significant attributes of APS in South Africa were payment of balance to the contractor upon project delivery; advance payment to contractors before the commencement of the work; and payment to contractors as agreed. This study proffers that project performance in terms of cost, time and quality performance is highly and positively supported by APS. Moreover, APS positively supports the efficiency, competitiveness and profitability of construction organisations. Cumulatively, these findings confirm that APS attributes in South Africa conforms to the global attributes of APS. The research concludes that client use of APS on projects improves the likelihood of attaining improved quality and time performance. This paper concludes with a recommendation that both public and private clients consider the option of an APS as the ideal payment system to support project and organisational performance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work constitutes the first attempt to explore the linkages between an APS, cash flow and project performance in South Africa and seeks to engender wider polemic debate and further discussion among industry stakeholders. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Which types of product attributes should central bank digital currencies have to be widely accepted? We answer this question by analyzing consumers’ acceptance of hypothetical payment methods. We used Japanese data from the 2019 Financial Literacy Survey to estimate a model of consumers’ ranking of the frequency of the use of five payment methods via three statistical models. The estimates of three models showed that the respondents to the survey value payment methods with shorter transaction times and mobile payment methods. Based on the estimates of these models, we conducted counterfactual simulations for the introduction of the hypothetical mobile version of noncash payment methods that required a shorter transaction time. We found that these hypothetical products would be the most frequently used payment methods on average; however, respondents with experience of financial troubles and with small financial asset holdings would use them less frequently. The results suggest that if the Bank of Japan wanted to issue a central bank digital currency that would be used almost every day as a replacement for cash, policy tools should be utilized to encourage the use of it by these groups as well. © 2021, Japanese Economic Association.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices now serve to pay for goods and services by means of the transmission of data, a system known as mobile payments. Mobile payment is receiving growing attention globally, from consumers to merchants, as an alternative to using cash, check, or credit cards. Most encryption techniques applied in mobile payment are based on traditional public key infrastructure. However, the traditional public key encryption algorithm has higher requirements for hardware, which is not suitable for mobile terminals of limited computing resources. In addition, these public key encryption algorithms are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks and the availability of practical quantum computer is approaching faster than previously believed. Since mobile payment is facing more and more security issues, how to complete the payment process effectively and securely becomes a problem urgently to be solved. In this paper, we firstly analyze the problem of the signature scheme for mobile payment and propose an improved signature scheme based on the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU). The results of the experiment show that the proposed signature scheme is secure and efficient which can raise the speed and probability of generating reasonable signature value. Second, we introduce a new public key infrastructure NTRU-WPKI and design a third-party mobile payment model based on NTRU-WPKI to increase the efficiency and security. Finally, by doing the overall simulation, we prove that our model is highly effective and secure. © 2013 IEEE.},

The model shows that if a pair of banks settle bank transfers between them without the central bank, a hold-up problem occurs when they bargain over the terms of settlement. This result stems from the confidentiality of bank-transfer requests, which makes it necessary for a depositor to retain an outside option to withdraw cash to enforce a bank-transfer request in a deposit contract. In light of this result, the large value payment system operated by the central bank can be regarded as an implicit interbank settlement contract to prevent a hold-up problem. In this contract, the central bank is characterized as the custodian of collateral. Bank reserves correspond to the balances of liquid collateral that banks submit to the central bank. This result can explain the rate-of-return dominance puzzle as well as why the central bank must replace liquid assets with bank reserves. The optimal implicit contract features a type of deferred net settlement in which the value of bank reserves transferred between banks is smaller than the net value of bank transfers to be settled. © 2018 The Author(s)},

Launched in 1997, Octopus cards are the world's most widely accepted contactless RFID electronic payment system. The system generates value for customers, service providers, and societies. This article makes a theoretical and applied contribution to our understanding of strategic information systems. It adopts and modifies Porter's value chain and develops value-chain flexibility as a theoretical framework to analyze the Octopus card system. The fast and dramatic changes in customer needs, business competition, and technological innovation are creating an urgent need for flexibility throughout the whole value chain. By looking at order fulfillment as a process, the shop outlet-either online or offline-is only part of the entire flow from customer enquiry to customer receipt. It is clear that no single idea could significantly reduce customer lead time. Only a total effort from organizations to increase flexibility and eliminate bottlenecks can make the kind of difference needed to compete (Day, 1994; Blackburn, 1991; Yusuf, Sarhadi, & Gunasekran, 1999). Therefore, value chain flexibility must be broadly defined, and it should be applied in the service industry. In other words, organizations should be able to deal with the uncertainty along the value chain to meet customer demands. This framework analyzes how the Octopus card system creates value and, in doing so, identifies key implications for customers, service providers, and society.},

	abstract = {Economic growth should be supplemented by an efficient payment and settlement system. Many attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of payment and settlement system in India. Especially the effort has been in terms of promoting digital economy. But the stickiness to payments through currency notes by the people has had a moderating effect on these efforts. The policy shift of Government of India towards demonetization of higher denomination currency notes has given thrust to digital payments. The study hypothesizes that post demonetization, the payment and settlement system indicators would show moderate to high deviation from the volume and value that can be forecasted using the historical data. Using Automatic ARIMA Forecasting in EViews, the forecasted values for the indicators for a period from November 2016 to March 2018 were estimated based on the historical data of the indicators from April 2011 to October 2016. The forecasted values of the indicators are then compared with the actual values of the indicators to see if they differ significantly by using paired t-test. The study finds evidence to suggest that the policy of demonetization and resultant reduced supply of currency notes has provided impetus to the Indian public to move towards digital platforms, and the increased supply of currency notes thereafter has not led to complete reversal of this shift in this change in consumer preference. This leads to the conclusion that through effective policy shifts, consumer preferences can be altered, and the Indian economy could become a less cash economy. © Subrahmanya Kumar N., Puttanna K., 2018.},

Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf outlined an alternative to the current monetary system in which banks are replaced by a peer-to-peer system to issue and transfer digital money: the Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has attracted a substantial investment volume, the system has not achieved the status of a viable alternative monetary system. However, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) underlying the payment system is being applied successfully by financial institutions and is likely to have important implications for the future of money and banking. In this paper we therefore focus on the most advanced distributed ledger application in the financial industry: R3 Corda. This paper is structured as follows. In the first section, we relate the debate about systems of money creation to the rise of Bitcoin. Next, the development of R3 Corda is discussed and the lessons learned for monetary reform. We conclude with an assessment of the scope and likelihood of monetary reform as a consequence of DLT applications by central banks.  © 2020 CONVIVIUM, association loi de 1901.},

The article first outlines how this will inevitably lead to the creation of a parallel crypto-asset market focused on offline wallets and peer-to-peer services outside the supervision of EU and national tax authorities. The article then highlights the important role that the so-called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will play in this environment. The differences between CBDCs and crypto-assets are examined from a tax assessment perspective in order to show that true anonymity is considerably less of an issue with (price stable) CBDCs than with (volatile) crypto-assets. The authors argue that a truly anonymous digital euro wallet for small transactions on the consumer side could not only allow the effective monitoring of businesses, but would actually increase tax compliance. If consumers have access to an anonymous cash-equivalent digital means of payment, they will be less likely to use cash or virtual currency. This in turn will cause a significant increase in available transaction data, while simultaneously granting a much better protection of taxpayers’ rights to privacy in the EU. © 2022 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands},

In exploring these factors, referring to the dual factor concept, this study enhances previous studies by integrating consumer intentions to adopt and resistance to adopt innovation in a research model. The research model was tested empirically using structural equation modeling (SEM) on data collected from 300 people targeting the market for NFC-based mobile payment products in Indonesia. Indonesia, which has the world’s fourth-largest population, the second largest number of cash transactions in the world, and cellular phone penetration rates and unbanked bankable numbers that are still very high, is a promising market share for NFC-based mobile payment. Amid these conditions, the rate of adoption of NFC-based mobile payments in Indonesia is not yet satisfactory. From the results of empirical testing it is known that the behavior in adopting NFC-based mobile payment is influenced by consumers’ intention to adopt, and resistance to adopt innovation. In addition to influencing innovation adoption behavior, consumer resistance to adopt innovation also influences consumer intentions to adopt the innovation. The consumer had perceptions that NFC-based mobile payment has advantages over existing innovations, by lifestyle and needs and are easy to use also need to be considered because it is proven to affect consumer intention to adopt NFC-based mobile payment. © IJSTR 2020.},

Based on data collecting from structured self-administered questionnaires of 228 Vietnamese bank account payers, the analytical results illustrate that the intention to use credit cards is negatively influenced by risk perception, which is synthesized from psychological risk, financial risk, performance risk, security risk, privacy risk, social risk and time risk with decreasing contribution. Some recommendations are made to reduce consumer concerns in order to encourage them signing up and using credit card as a mean of payment for daily expenses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Limited research has explored the effects of mobile payments on restaurant performance from the perspective of restaurateurs. This study utilized a combination of the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to investigate the influence of a near-field-communication (NFC) mobile payment environment on restaurant operating performance (ROP). Through convenience sampling, questionnaires were distributed to restaurant owners and managers, resulting in 279 valid responses. The empirical findings revealed that sales growth (β = 0.478), cost savings (β = −0.236), flexibility (β = 0.117), accessibility (β = 0.184), and trust and safety (β = 0.286) significantly impacted ROP. When considering restaurant size as a moderator for analysis, only two constructs, namely, accessibility (β = 0.108) and trust and safety (β = −0.160), showed significant impacts on ROP. These empirical insights offer valuable references to restaurateurs for enhancing ROP by leveraging the mobile payment environment. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The incidence of COVID-19 has systematically decreased households' use of cash as means of payment as well as the average size and frequency of cash withdrawals. We argue that the structure of Baumol-Tobin type inventory theoretical models and their extensions can be used to separate the confounding factors, such as the desired level of consumption and the choice of the fraction of consumption paid in cash, from the cash management behavior, i.e. the size and frequency of cash withdrawals. Using this insight we argue that the observed cash management is consistent with COVID-19 increasing the fixed cost of withdrawing cash. We use detailed data on ATM cash disbursements in Argentina, Chile, and the US to estimate how much the pandemic has changed the transaction cost of using cash. This estimation shows that if the intensity of the virus doubles in a county, cash transaction cost increases by approximately 2%. The results from Argentina, Chile, and the US are remarkably similar and robust to several forms of measurement error and endogeneity. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study quantifies the impact of the Dutch cash payment system on the environment and on climate change using a life cycle assessment (LCA). It examines both the impact of coins and of banknotes. In addition, it identifies areas within the cash payment system where the impact on the environment and on the climate can be reduced. Methods: The ReCiPe endpoint (H) impact method was used for this LCA. The cash payment system has been divided into five subsystems: the production of banknotes, the production of coins, the operation phase, the end of life of banknotes and the end of life of coins. Two functional units were used: (1) cumulative cash payments in the Netherlands in 2015 and (2) the average single cash payment in the Netherlands in 2015. Input data for all processes within each subsystem was collected through interviews and literature study. Ten key companies and authorities in the cash payment chain contributed data, i.e. the Dutch central bank, the Royal Dutch Mint, a commercial bank, a cash logistic service provider, two cash-in-transit companies, two printing works, an ATM manufacturer and a municipal waste incinerator. Results and discussion: The environmental impact of the Dutch cash payment system in 2015 was 2.42 MPt (expressed in eco points) and its global warming potential (GWP) was 19 million kg CO2 equivalents (CO2e). For an average single cash transaction, the environmental impact was 654 μPt and the GWP was 5.1 g CO2e. The operation phase (e.g. energy use of ATMs, transport of banknotes and coins) (64%) and coin production phase (31%) had the largest impact on the environment, while the operation phase also had the largest impact on climate change human health (89%) and climate change ecosystems (56%). Finally, scenario analysis shows that reductions of the environmental impact (47%) and the impact on climate change (50%) could be achieved by implementing a number of measures, namely reducing the number of ATMs, stimulating the use of renewable energy in ATMs, introducing hybrid trucks for cash transport and matching coins with other countries in the euro area. Conclusions: This is the first study that investigates the environmental impact and GWP of the cash payment system in the Netherlands, by taking both the impact of banknotes and coins into account. The total environmental impact of cash payments in 2015 was 2.42 MPt and their GWP was 19 million kg CO2e. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Paying for these with standard methods of payments, such as cash, checks, credit card, or debit card, may be ineffective or inefficient.

Several things need to be considered when investigating electronic card payment system options, including: customer needs and benefits, developmental and operational cost, corporate benefits, continually changing technologies, critical mass of customers, security, standards of payment systems, and customer perception and comfort with new technologies. In this article, we analyze how smart card-based systems are used in mass transportation. Managers in mass transportation face the following questions: Do you develop your own electronic card payment system, do you wait for multifunctional cards that will be accepted across many industries to provide the functionality required in your market, or do you do nothing. The discussion here concentrates mainly on the transportation industry, where the transactions and payments are made on local area networks.},

In order to make the entire society participate in using non-cash transaction, NFC mobile payment is chosen as the suitable technology that can reach out to all type of society including the banked and the unbanked community. This research is focused on studying the adoption of NFC mobile payment using UTAUT model within the framework of SEM. The research was conducted in Jabodetabek on both banked and unbanked community. The result showed that there is a significant difference on banked and unbanked people's perception. Those who are considered as banked people think that TCASH is useful and give benefits to their life, while this isn't applied to unbanked people as their tendency to use TCASH is still based on great influence from other parties. Because of this, it's better for Telkomsel to create an innovative strategy to maintain its position in the banked community while also develop a new business strategy that's more suitable for the unbanked community. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Economists often say that certain types of assets, e.g., Treasury bonds, are very ‘liquid’. Do they mean that these assets are likely to serve as media of exchange or collateral (a definition of liquidity often employed in monetary theory), or that they can be easily sold in a secondary market, if needed (a definition of liquidity closer to the one adopted in finance)? We develop a model where these two notions of asset liquidity coexist, and their relative importance is determined endogenously in general equilibrium: how likely agents are to visit a secondary market in order to sell assets for money depends on whether sellers of goods/services accept these assets as means of payment. But, also, the incentive of sellers to invest in a technology that allows them to recognize and accept assets as means of payment depends on the existence (and efficiency) of a secondary market where buyers could liquidate assets for cash. The interaction between these two channels offers new insights regarding the determination of asset prices and the ability of assets to facilitate transactions and improve welfare. We also use our model to study the efficacy of recent policy interventions in asset markets. © 2020},

Yet, the choice of payment system affects the costs and barriers faced by those receiving cash as well as the costs and risks of successful programme implementation. This article proposes a theoretical framework for evaluating payment systems and then applies it to three different payment systems being used in cash transfer programmes in Kenya: payment to recipients' mobile phones that can be redeemed at various phone agents; payment through 'smartcards' that can be redeemed at various banking agents using fingerprint technology for identification; and payment through post offices. Both qualitative and quantitative evidence is presented to assess challenges in implementing the three systems, difficulties recipients face in using them, and the effects these systems have on the impact of cash transfer programmes.},

	abstract = {Mobile payments are a new and alternative payment method. Instead of using traditional methods like cash, cheque, or credit cards, a customer can use a mobile phone to transfer money or to pay for goods and services. Mobile payments have numerous advantages over traditional payment methods. Apart from their apparent flexibility, they enable consumers who do not have easy access to banking facilities to participate readily in financial transactions. Unfortunately, existing mobile payment solutions in India are not interoperable; i.e. they only offer services for merchants registered with them and do not allow the transfer of money to, or between, users of other payment providers. This limitation reduces the widespread adoption of mobile payments. In this paper, we propose new mobile payment architectures that support interoperability. A key technical aspect of the mobile payment process is to lookup customer details, for which we propose the following three design options: (1) a central database, (2) a peer-to-peer query, or (3) a hierarchical lookup. These options are evaluated using relevant metrics such as the complexity of implementation and scalability with respect to system size. Based on our evaluation we recommend that initially the peer-to-peer design is chosen, and once the technology is more widespread, the central database option should be adopted. ©2010 IEEE.},

The ability to pay in cash affects the demand for rides, which is reflected in large changes in the total number of trips, fares, miles, and number of users after Uber introduced cash payments, particularly in lower-income city blocks. On the other hand, the effects on prices, estimated times of arrival, and competitor pricing are negligible, consistent with the supply of trips being very elastic. Although cash payments naturally increase the fraction of users that pay exclusively with cash, more than half of the users have access to both cards and cash, and alternate between payment methods. We find evidence consistent with cash and card payments being imperfectly substitutable at both the intensive and extensive margins, which magnifies the effect of policies that restrict the availability of payment methods.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

The data analysis techniques used in this article are in the form of data reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The results of this study state that there are differences of opinion between the Indonesian Ulema Council and the Saudi Arabian Fatwa Institute. The Saudi Arabian fatwa institution issued a fatwa regarding the prohibition of buying and selling gold in futures, because gold is a type of usury property and contains 'illat as a unit of price or means of payment. Meanwhile, the National Sharia Council of the Indonesian Ulema Council stipulates a fatwa regarding the permissibility of buying and selling gold in cash or futures, because at this time, gold is no longer a price (tsaman), but gold is an ordinary merchandise or commodity. The discussion about buying and selling gold is in the realm of ijtihad, which is inseparable from differences of opinion (khilafiyah), because there is no definite text in this matter. © 2022, Institut Agama Islam Negeri Batusangkar.

It also investigates the regulation of cash in the context of controlling crime stemming from the cash economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study relies on primary data generated from 20 interviewees drawn from the National Bank of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Financial Intelligence Center, selected commercial banks and law enforcement agencies and document review from government reports, media press and statutes, as well as secondary data from online and offline sources. Findings: The cash-intensive nature of Ethiopia’s economy has enabled a significant amount of cash to circulate outside of the formal financial system. This money is partly to blame for the prevalence of criminal activities such as cash hoarding, corruption and illicit financial flows. To address the threat of crime posed by the cash economy, the Ethiopian Government has taken measures such as restricting cash withdrawals from financial institutions, limiting the amount of cash individuals can hold and demonetizing the banknotes. The measures enable the banks to collect the cash circulating outside of the formal financial sector. However, the effect of these measures on reducing future criminality remains uncertain. Improving the financial inclusivity of the country, specifically expanding basic financial products to the rural areas, digitalizing the country’s payment system, raising general financial awareness and establishing a strong financial consumer protection framework would play a critical role in reducing future criminality and transforming the cash-intensive into a cashless economy. Originality/value: This paper provides a first-of-its-kind analytical perspective on the contribution of Ethiopia’s cash economy to criminal activity and the adequacy of countermeasures so far taken. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Previous experience in non-NFC mobile payments had a significant positive association with intention to adopt NFC mobile payment. Among the beliefs, consumers with higher trust and higher perceived usefulness about NFC mobile payment had greater intentions to adopt it. Moreover, trust was found to have a mediating effect between non-NFC mobile payment experience and the intention to adopt NFC mobile payment.

	abstract = {This study aims to predict the impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) issuance on the net interest income (NII) of commercial banks in Vietnam-the main and most important source of revenue for financial institutions with the assumption that CBDCs issued by the State Bank of Vietnam would be widely accessible, coexist as a supplement to cash, and be viewed by consumers as an alternative to bank deposits, thereby the net interest income of commercial banks would be adversely affected. The predictive analysis with the panel data model is applied to this study to specifically assess the impact of the CBDC issuance on the NII of 13 typical commercial banks in Vietnam. The result shows that even in the backdrop of favorable growth in macroeconomic data, issuing CBDC will have a direct impact on percent cash and will slow commercial banks' NII growth in which large banks may be more vulnerable than smaller banks with higher return savings deposits. This opens up a quest for the future to continue to study and evaluate the impact on other performance indicators of the bank in comprehensively to identify adaptive solutions in the inevitable context of the digital economy. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the implementation of a mobile network system for an Islamic microfinance institution, made in collaboration with a commercial bank in Malaysia. It also intends to highlight any emerging issues pertaining to the implementation of technology into the disbursement and repayment system of an Islamic microfinance institution from their clients' perspectives. As Islamic microfinance industry is still growing in Malaysia, findings gathered throughout the course of study are also intended to boost further knowledge relating to this area. Design/methodology/approach - By using a case study method, interview sessions were conducted separately with clients of the Islamic microfinance institution. The purpose of interview sessions is to identify the benefits and problem that surrounds the usage of mobile banking into the repayment system for Islamic microfinance products. Data triangulation with various public documents was conducted to enhance the credibility and reliability of data, also to support the claims that were made by the respondents. Findings - It was found that clients are quite satisfied with the disbursement process through a mobile solution. However, the same cannot be said with the repayment process. The difficulties in using the mobile solution pose a major threat to its success. As most clients are not born to be technological savvy, the lack of easiness in methods for the usage of a mobile solution for their transactions pushes them away from further exploring the benefits that can be brought in by the function. Other risks which were highlighted include concerns towards breach of trust and risks of robbery. Clients of the case study, on the other hand, are concerned that the transfer of cash between their meeting venues to the bank would expose them to the public who might try to take advantage from the situation. Research limitations/implications - As the current study had only focusses on mobile banking aspect of the repayment system for one Islamic microfinance institution, a multiple case study could be adapted to investigate various banking channels being implemented by different Islamic microfinance institutions in Malaysia and their current success. Practical implications - By highlighting several issues through this study, it is hoped that this Islamic microfinance institution would consider applying other means of payment that are available in the market that is not only cost-efficient, but also beneficial for clients of the institution. Originality/value - This study highlights the setbacks in the usage of technology by clients of Islamic microfinance institution in Malaysia. Although many approved to the diffusion of innovation in Malaysian banking sector, the same has yet to be achieved in the Islamic microfinance industry, which clients are mostly technology illiterate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, digital currency has received widespread attention from central banks in recent years. As an important financial infrastructure, the UnionPay network is expected to provide effective support for the construction and operation of a digital currency system. This study uses the UnionPay network as basis to systematically propose a digital currency information system from three aspects, namely, digital currency account opening, exchange, and use, and further expounds on the operation mechanism of a digital currency information system prototype. This study also discusses how to apply blockchain technology to digital currency, such as using distributed ledger for digital currency confirmation and registration and using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to realize the forward guidance function of the central bank digital currency. Lastly, the current research introduces the value of using the UnionPay network to support the operation of a digital currency information system and its technical challenges, aiming to provide beneficial guidance and reference for future research effort. © Higher Education Press 2020.},

	abstract = {Using a proprietary data set containing more than 10 million transactions over 14 months from hundreds of grocery stores, we examine consumer payment choices at point of sale (POS) between cash and mobile, where the use of other methods (including cards) is minimal. We find that cash is the dominant method of payment. Nonetheless, the share of mobile payments has increased at the expense of cash payments over time. Importantly, we exploit price incentives for consumers using mobile payment to examine the price substitution between cash and mobile payments. Our results show that consumers are more likely to use mobile payment when they receive price incentives for doing so, and such an effect persists for a few days, even after the price incentive expires. Nonetheless, the price incentives are unlikely financed by additional transactions paid via mobile but subsidized by mobile payment providers. Interestingly, we find several factors that enhance and supplement the steering effect of price incentives. First, a larger monetary reward seems to induce a stronger impact of price incentive on mobile payment. Second, the steering effect of price incentive is stronger for stores that serve consumers who have frequently been using mobile payment and for price-sensitive consumers. Third, the additional mobile payments come from transactions that would not have occurred with price incentive and those that switch from cash transactions. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS.},

The Government of India is encouraging use of a variety of payment systems post demonetization in November 2016. The focus of this paper was to understand the use of point-of-sale (POS) systems installed by merchants and service providers for receiving payments from customers for transactions involving sale of goods and services to the public. The primary focus of the paper was to understand the adaptability, affordability, and sustainability of the payments system as seen from the point of view of small merchants. The paper is based on a study conducted in 2017, aimed at understanding the different types of payment systems that are available to the small merchants. It also looked at the difficulties faced by them and their effect on their businesses. A total of 221 responses were collected in Chennai, capital city of Tamil Nadu in South India. The results showed that cash remained the most preferred mode for business. Cash was required for working capital, payment of employee remuneration, wages, and others. With regards to the use of payment systems like POS, more awareness needs to be created about the benefits in having non-cash transactions. It seemed that the merchants would be convinced if it could improve credit worthiness and eligibility to receive loans from banks. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.

Inefficient processes, poor physical infrastructure, inadequate access to and poor reliability of digital technologies, and the costs are limiting the digitalization by small retail stores.

	abstract = {Purpose – Due to country-wise lockdown and state-wise curfews in COVID-19, people were not able to make offline payments (i.e. cash payments) during purchases in India. So, people are switching their payment behavior from offline to online mode. But, as per the central bank report, the rate of adoption through mobile payments is still slow. The paper focuses on identifying critical barriers to mobile payment systems (MPSs) adoption in India. Innovation resistance theory (IRT) has been used as a base model for barriers, despite the wide range of choices of barriers avail-able in the MPSs context. Additionally, three external variables which are out of the wider coverage of IRT constructs were incorporated in this paper. The study, on the other hand, adds to innovation resistance theory in the frame of reference of MPSs from a theoretical perspective. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM), together with MICMAC analysis is brought into play to analyse the direct and indirect relationship amongst the barriers. Research methodology – ISM approach has been used to establish the relationship among the eight (08) identified barriers, through literature and expert opinions. The key barriers to high driving power are then identified with the help of MICMAC analysis. Findings – The results reveal that value barrier (b2), image barrier (b5) and visibility barrier (b7) are the most significant variables. Interestingly, IRTs’ risk barrier (b3) and privacy barrier (b6) from the literature fall in the lowest level of the ISM model. The majority of the barriers fall under quadrant III of MICMAC analysis, indicating the high driving and dependence power. Research limitations – The developed ISM model is based on the sentiments of five (05) experts, which could be biased and influence the structural model’s final output. Due to COVID-19, data has been collected through online video conferencing mode, this may vary if data will be collected through an offline or face-to-face interview. The proposed model’s key findings aim to assist in explaining the barriers that exist during MPS adoption. Originality/Value – This study is the first attempt to use the ISM approach in conjunction with IRT to detect barriers within MPSs. The result of this paper will guide and motivate the researcher to analyse more critical barriers with IRT to contribute to the theoretical development. © 2022 The Author(s).

The demand for money is very crucial in the conduct and determination of the effectiveness of monetary policy. This study attempts to analyse whether financial innovations that occurred in Nigeria after the Structural Adjustment Programme of 1986 has affected the demand for money in Nigeria using the Engle and Granger Two-Step Cointegration technique. Though the study revealed that demand for money conforms to the theory that income is positively related to the demand for cash balances and interest rate has an inverse relationship with the demand for real cash balances, it was also discovered that the financial innovations introduced into the financial system have not significantly affected the demand for money in Nigeria. Based on the results obtained, a policy of attracting more participants (non-government) and private sector funds to the money market is necessary as this will deepen the market and make the market more dynamic and amenable to monetary policy. Therefore, the study concludes that financial innovation has had no significant impact on the demand for money in Nigeria and the SAP era financial liberalization policies have had no indirect impact on the demand for money as well. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.},

On the other hand, users in big city like Jakarta, with their rapid pace of knowledge absorption and tremendous social impact, may find these concerns to be unfounded. Based on this, the purpose of this study is to examine the behavioral drivers of QRIS users’ desire to use the system, as well as to explain whether the utility of technology and resistance to technology more powerful reasons can be than fear in utilizing this non-cash payment method. Using 208 individuals, this study was able to demonstrate that technology usability aspects and aversion to technology are more important than technology anxiety and security views. QRIS gives more benefits to users of non-cash payment methods in metropolitan cities than the difficulty, discomfort, or fear of utilizing it. The usage of a research region that only covers one city and the use of participant criteria that can be made more specific for future studies are both limitations of this study. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Smartphones instead of cash: mobile phone manufacturers, network operators and financial institutions committed themselves to make mobile phones ready for money exchange. A study of the Handelsblatt [1] assumes that the expansion of mobile devices in the next years will increase significantly. According to this trend it is clear why the topic of mobile payment is discussed more recently in research and industry. In this paper we will demonstrate a software system which handles the payment process through the usage of a mobile device and a decentral payment server. The decentral payment server works like a transaction gateway between the mobile device and the corresponding bank server using the FinTS [2] protocol. For user authentication abstract methods like NFC [3] (ex. German eID-Card [4]) or services like PayPal, REST or LDAP can be used which make the system flexible for many different use-cases. The system can be used within the mobile operating systems Android, iOS and Windows Mobile. Another important fact is the decentralization of the system because this will lead to a very inexpensive system regarding transaction fees and the possibility to host the payment system in-house makes the system interesting for companies. By using this decentral architecture there will not be a central payment provider holding thousands of interesting transaction data which could be a target for data theft or data profiling. To proof this concept a sample project was implemented and will be shown at the end of this paper. © 2012 IEEE.},

Many countries have started research in this direction. The status of research varies - some countries are at the stage of public discussions; others are preparing the concept of CBDC to test or launch a ready-made solution. This article analyzes the Bank of Russia's program to create a digital ruble and compares the proposed ways to build a CBDC in Russia with the experience of other countries. The focus is on the analysis of the development of digital currencies in Sweden, China, the European Union and the Bahamas. It is established that central banks do not have a clear opinion on the level of authority of the Regulator in ensuring the functioning of the system, centralization and tokenization of CBDC. The article highlights the main trends in the development of digital currencies. It is established that an essential factor for building a CBDC is the central bank's understanding of the purpose of introducing a digital currency in the country. For the digital ruble, recommendations for building relationships with clients and intermediaries based on the experience of other countries are formulated.  © 2021 ACM.},

We run hypothetical scenarios that correspond to public discussions about the digital euro. Results show that introducing an rCBDC without attractive design options and stimulus results in low and slow adoption. Results suggest that the reverse waterfall functionality, a positive remuneration spread, and the distribution of government subsidies via rCBDC are effective in fostering adoption; yet, the distribution of government subsidies via rCBDC is the only one that creates incentives to reduce the use of cash. Balance limits and top-up limits are effective in restraining adoption. Results also suggest that combining design options and stimulus with limits to holding rCBDCs could aid in achieving a sweet spot of adoption. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.},

The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of technological infrastructure and financial access factors on cashless economy development. The impact of the infrastructure factor is assessed in case of Ukraine, using NBU’s data on payment infrastructure during 2001–2022. The hypothesis of the boosting effect of financial access towards a cashless economy has been tested using the method of correlation between M0/M3 and different indicators of financial access (usage of essential technologies, financial services) based on data of World Bank, IMF, and Triple-A in 2021. The study’s results show that globally there is an almost linear relationship between the number of open financial accounts and the increase in the level of cashless (0.954). It is also revealed that the rise of the share of the population making electronic payments decreases the share of cash in the economy. It is determined that the spread of the crypto-assets has a significant impact on the reduction of cash in the economy (an increase in the share of the population operating with cryptocurrencies by 1% reduces the share of cash by 0.5%). Regarding regulatory policies, it is proposed to stimulate the coverage of the population with open financial accounts, making mandatory payments with electronic payment systems and developing their infrastructure. © Yevhen Bublyk, Yuliia Shapoval, Oleksii Shpanel-Yukhta, Svitlana Brus, 2023.},

However, if CBDC still offers a relatively high level of anonymity but a low interest rate, then introducing CBDC will decrease the output from not only agents who launder money but also agents who do not. If CBDC instead offers low anonymity and a high interest rate, then introducing CBDC can increase aggregate welfare without lowering output. Furthermore, introducing CBDC needs not increase the funding costs of banks or decrease bank lending. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Its salient features are that it is a traceable system with an efficient mechanism for verifying transactions. Net coins are reusable and can be easily passed from one user to another. The issuing of virtual currency and verification of transactions are performed by trusted mints, which act as the gateway between the fiat and virtual currency worlds. There is no need to maintain a public ledger, which would inhibit use on a global scale because of rapidly increasing memory and bandwidth requirements. The system is neither inflationary nor deflationary in nature and does not purport a new economic model. As a fiat-backed currency it should not suffer the volatility issues associated with Bit coin. In this paper the two most prominent electronic payment systems of the last forty years, namely Ecash and Bit coin, are examined. Net coin is then introduced in detail and is designed to address the shortcomings of these payment systems. © 2015 IEEE.},

CBDCs are a type of central bank digital currency that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including digital payment. Central banks have the potential to provide a cost-effective and inclusive digital payment solution also for the unbanked population and support economic growth. However, the impacts of CBDCs are still uncertain, both in terms of the magnitude and probability of effects. Central banks should have a multifaceted strategy that includes understanding, identifying, managing, and mitigating risks associated with CBDC design to manage unintended macroeconomic consequences. This involves assessing demand for CBDCs, evaluating deposit structures and vulnerabilities to disintermediation, examining the effectiveness of proposed measures like caps, and considering changes in money velocity and monetary policies regimes. Strengthening liquidity management is crucial to mitigate liquidity risks arising from CBDCs funded by bank deposits. Therefore, this paper focuses on the impact of CBDCs on monetary policy, including deposit disintermediation and increased volatility of commercial bank reserves. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {The London Clearing Banks (LCBs) have successfully used payment systems to establish a customer franchise, through which they have gained cheap retail deposits and provided lending and other services. Yet they have failed to price the service rationally. Market growth has dramatically increased the volume of payments, exacerbating the cost problem. To counter this, the LCBs have introduced additional payment mechanisms such as credit cards and Bankers’ Automated Clearing Service (BACS); are introducing electronic fund transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS); and are further automating the existing cash and cheque-based system. The development of the clearing house, BA CS and EFTPOS demonstrates how payment systems impose co-operative policies to facilitate the transfer of funds and reduce costs, but such enforced co-operation tends to lead to perfect competition, with uniform pricing policies. Competitors are in a strong position to operate more efficient and less expensive payments media for their customers. The dilemma facing the LCBs is therefore how to match this challenge and maintain their market position through further investment in payments technology, while maintaining their existing less efficient and more expensive payments media. © 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

	abstract = {In an increasingly digitised world, and within the new reality of digital finance, a fully digitised public currency seems to be a natural step. To this end, central banks have been testing the possibility to issue a digital form of the traditional fiat currency (so-called Central Bank Digital Currency-CBDC). As these projects steadily progress, and in some cases, reach the implementation phase, a myriad of questions, from legal to macroeconomic, arise. This paper aims to focus, in particular, on two complementary and co-related aspects involving CBCDs: (i) how can the full digitalisation and centralisation of the transaction ledger be combined with privacy and (ii) to what extent CBDCs affect the allocation of burden and the responsibility over supervision of retail transactions. Eminently, the use of cash ensures a form of default privacy that protects the individual against State and private intrusion. While this privacy has caused concern, due to its criminogenic potential, and has been consequently limited by anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, the remaining cone of shadow cash guarantees is a crucial limit to control. In the context of a shifting financial system, undergoing deep transformation due to increasing datafication and decentralisation of the market, a new governance of financial supervision and record-keeping—up to now based on a unique and centralised ledger—is crucial to redefine the trade-off between financial integrity and privacy. This article will examine the origins and characteristics of CBDCs, to then analyse how the trade-off between control and privacy is set to reshape this new architecture. © The Author(s) 2024.},

However, the use of this technology still does not show its significance, especially when compared to similar countries. Therefore, this study proposes a theoretical framework based on push–pull–mooring, with factors derived from motivation theory, technology acceptance model and other theories. The research findings underscore the comparison of perceived value internally (efficiency and effectiveness) and externally (discounts, rebates and others) as push and pull factors for users to switch from cash to MP. Furthermore, mooring proxies represented by switching costs and self-efficacy provide a unique understanding of the body of knowledge in the discussed field. The practical action proposed for MP service providers is to always improve quality in terms of accessibility for technical use, and collaboration with related parties is important. Also, for policymakers in Indonesia, deployment of information technology infrastructure and accommodating policies to facilitate licensing for service providers to ensure the security of deposit funds, user data and personal profiles. © 2023 MDI.},

In this article, we construct a general model of a card platform that unifies the literature on interchange fees. We enrich the existing frameworks by analyzing the choice of the interchange fee when consumer demand is elastic to retail prices. We show that the difference between the privately set structure of payment card fees and the socially optimal one depends both on banks' and merchants' pass-through of their costs to consumers. We argue that the maturity of the payment card market impacts the redistributive effects of interchange fees (i.e. between consumers and merchants, card and cash users) and therefore, their optimal regulation. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

	abstract = {Digital currencies have the potential to improve the speed and efficiency of the payment system. The principal challenge is retail: to facilitate day-to-day payments among consumers as an alternative to cash, both domestically and across national borders. Two models of digital currencies are becoming viable: central bank digital currencies and nongovernment-issued currencies that are backed by assets having intrinsic value (stablecoins or, when widely used internationally, global stablecoins). Because they are not government issued, global stablecoins present complex and novel cross-border regulatory challenges, including managing the costs of complying with a multitude of national laws and ensuring international legal enforceability. Given the rapid growth of stablecoins, these challenges urgently need legal solutions. Two strategies have been devised for addressing similar challenges: either enact an international treaty or propose a model law for the relevant jurisdictions uniformly to enact as their national law. The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) itself exemplifies such a model law, designed to reduce the high costs of coordinating and complying with different commercial laws in U.S.interstate domestic transactions. This Article analyzes a model-law strategy to regulate global stablecoins, showing it should be more politically realistic than a treaty approach. The Article also designs, critiques, and proposes possible text for such a model law. The model law should be politically feasible for nations to enact because, as the Article shows, its design and proposed text are generally consistent with the principles and recommendations advanced by the world’s leading central banks and multinational financial organizations for regulating global stablecoins. © 2022 Vanderbilt Law Review.

A continuum exists between the extremes of totally on-line and totally off-line payment systems, and there exist business motivations to establishing an intermediate “working point.” Our security goal is to protect the systems against economically motivated adversaries. Let the adversarial expenses (to interfere with normal operation of wallets) be Cb, and 1/d be the audit sampling rate, and for simplicity assume that each payment has a value of one unit. Then when the adversarial payer breaks even with her investment, Cb, the probability not to detect her is O(exp(-Cb/d)). A curious observation on the so called “after the fact double-spender exposure” mechanisms unexpectedly falls from the analysis of randomized audit mechanisms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

	abstract = {There is already a consensus among central banks to accelerate the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). To facilitate a smooth money transfer process, the interactive experience of the CBDC user interface design is very important. However, much of the current research has focused on the technical feasibility of the CBDCs, and no scientific research has yet attempted to design an effective CBDC user interface. In this study, a series of CBDC user interfaces were designed to help study the interaction process of CBDCs in a simulated payment transaction context with a focus on the user interface and interactive experience of the CBDCs. The experiment in this study was a 2 (graphical metaphor) × 3 (gesture type) × 2 (visual feedback) mixed factorial design in which a total of 12 CBDC prototypes were created and evaluated based on users’ task performance and a series of subjective evaluations. The results of our empirical study revealed that graphical metaphor user interface design can improve the interface usability and subjective evaluation of CBDCs, and may also trigger the user’s sense of experience with traditional banknotes. Specifically, the use of animated cues for currency movement on the CBDC user interface may help evoke the user’s experience of using cash. In addition, we found that the wave type gesture may cause users to spend more time completing the CBDC operational tasks. Moreover, the animated cue of money moving may have faster performance and a higher degree of rationality. The above-mentioned results may provide an important design reference for CBDC developers to create easy-to-use CBDC services. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper discusses the expectations that e-cash would need to meet, from a user perspective, and argues that e-cash would need to have more in common with modern account-based electronic and mobile account payments than with traditional cash. Were central banks to launch e-cash, they would be in direct competition with private payment services. A successful e-cash service would therefore require a competitive edge over private electronic payment services. This would create a risk of market distortion for both payments and deposit services. Regulatory issues such as know-your-customer requirements and account/transaction liabilities would play a major role in e-cash services. Central bank e-cash would have to fulfil the basic payment instrument requirements of a sufficiently large segment of the payments market. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

It simplifies procedures and allows microelectronics technology to advance more often. It was managed by an Android app and controlled by sensor networks and parking systems. The wireless sensor network manages parking spot management, parking lot reservations, vehicle navigation, and other complex circumstances. This study suggests a wireless sensor network-based and android app-based intelligent parking system. Sensors installed beneath enable the cutting-edge parking system to function. The research suggests an intelligent parking system that uses wireless sensor networks and IR, magnetic, and light sensors. The ground-level sensors used by the advanced parking system function. The base station receives the node/slot information, and the base station delivers data to FTP. At the user's request, FTP transmits details about nodes and spaces to mobile devices. The idea came from using an IoT application to control the automobile parking system, which is crucial to our daily lives. For this purpose, a mobile application for Android called Smart Parker was developed. It provides information about a parking lot, such as available or reserved spaces. Sensors at the base station will send information about parking spaces to the FTP server. The user of the innovative payment system is required to pay to park the car. Cash is first collected using cash counters, but maintaining them is challenging. Later, different methods are employed to collect the payment. The payment is made by an Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) tag using RFID technologies. Smart, debit, and credit cards are contact methods, whereas RFID technology and mobile devices are contactless alternatives. The smart parking system on FPGA (Finite State Machine Modeling) works on two main modules, i.e., the identification module and slot checking module. The identification module identifies the visitor, and the slot-checking module checks the status. These modules are modeled in HDL and implemented on an FPGA. When a vehicle enters the parking lot, LCD determines whether space is available in the parking lot. If space is available, the stepper motor rotates, and the door opens for the vehicle entrance. The RF module is used to transmit and receive slot availability information. According to the information, the driver can park the vehicle. The host computer acts as a control unit. Once the host computer program runs, the FPGA, identification, and slot-checking modules activate. This system will be used and monitored for more wireless sensor network research  © 2023 IEEE.},

In 2018, Indonesia is proven to be a good market for mobile payment and estimated to continue to grow in 2020. This will make competition between mobile payment tougher in Indonesia. Mobile payment companies need to maintain the quality of services and applications in order to meet customer satisfaction. User reviews or complaints expressed on Twitter were used in this study. Pre-processing data is used to convert unstructured and semi-structured text into an understandable format. The Term Frequency matrix is used to calculate the number of occurrences of the token. Word cloud is used to represent the most repeated words that represent the word size. It can be used to find out what services are widely reviewed or complained by customers. The data in this study are tweets with Bahasa Indonesia therefore, the result for word cloud is also in Bahasa Indonesia. The eight frequently used words in the data can be grouped into mobile payment company, monetary rewards, mobile payment transaction and customer service. © 2020 IEEE.},

Though the services provided are satisfactory, we need a smart and reliable system. Major issues faced by the passengers are waiting for the bus, non-refund of balance cash, over loaded buses, etc. Thus to provide agile and smooth ticketing experience, we have proposed a smart application that will allocate seats for the passengers, can reserve tickets digitally, and the mode payments will be cashless. Thereby, promoting digitalization and smart cities initiatives. The source of users will be added automatically when connected to the device at the bus stop. The user can check the availability of tickets and select the seats. If selected seats are not vacant, then the algorithm will automatically allot the seats that are available. The user can book seats only if they are connected to the device at the bus stop and can make digital payment through the portal. The ticket booking will generate an E-ticket as an acknowledgement that will be verified by the conductor at the time of boarding. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {India presently faces the challenge of achieving financial inclusion, with the banking system estimated to be covering only 400 million of India's population of 1.2 billion. As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, current users of the banking system are largely in urban areas. An important aspect of achieving financial inclusion is also to provide a means for cash management in a safe, effective and low-cost manner. The well-documented telecom boom in India with an estimated 900 million individual users provides a potential framework that could transform the banking system in India. This paper proposes a framework for mobile phone companies to offer payment services to start with, called "payment banks". New technologies can reform the banking sector apart from giving a much needed impetus for the cause of financial inclusion and will be a large step forward in spreading banking services to millions of new clients in the under-banked regions of India. The need for a "Payment Bank" has been discussed in the NachiketMor Committee Report of the RBI. Our paper formulates a theoretical model for achieving financial Inclusion by leveraging advantages in technology in India and enabling select Telecom operators to offer rudimentary cash management services to start with before offering a bouquet of financial services products to the vast majority of India's population who do not avail of the existing network of Banks. The paper suggests possible basic changes to enable this process apart from using existing infrastructure to enable wider dissemination of financial products. An impact analysis of these suggested changes are also discussed along with remedial measures.},

Electronic cash (e-cash) has acted an important role, but e-cash is digital data that can be copied easily, resulting in double spending. To ensure the security and fairness of transactions, researchers designed secure e-cash payment systems. In 1982, Chaum proposed the first payment scheme using an RSA-based, blind signature to achieve anonymity. Since then, many studies have been conducted, but most related schemes still have high costs associated with the computations. In this paper, we propose a new, secure, e-cash payment system using elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) and secret sharing combined with cloud computing to provide lower cost than previous systems. Our proposed scheme also can meet the requirements of a well-designed, secure, e-cash payment system. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Besides the financial and economic factors also the security and scalability of technical implementation of CBDC have been studied. Blockchain technology provides high level of security independent of the technical infrastructure and enables central banks to outsource most of the CBDC operations to the private sector while still having full control over the total amount of CBDC in circulation. Scalability of blockchain solutions depends on the possibility of decomposing (sharding) the blockchain. Electronic money and payments can be represented and organized in several ways, including accounts, bills/coins, and also unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). We show how the representation of money and payments influences the existence of secure and decomposable blockchain implementations of electronic money. We show that the bill money scheme can be securely and efficiently implemented as sharded blockchains. © 2022, The Author(s).},

To ensure that customers noticed the error in the bill, the experiment was restricted to single customers who ordered two items only (e.g., coffee and a toasted sandwich), presenting them with a bill from which one item, either the more or the less expensive one, was omitted. A majority of customers (169 out of 278) failed to bring the error to the server's attention. Several factors appeared to have a large effect on the decision of whether to report the bill error. Female customers reported the error in the bill much more often than male customers, customers whose more expensive item was omitted from the bill reported the error twice as often than customers whose less expensive item was omitted, repeated customers (presumably) reported the error much more often than one-time customers and customers who paid with a credit card reported the error much more often than customers who paid in cash. We also consider the possibility that the means of payment is a choice variable determined by the decision of whether or not to bring the error in the bill to the server's attention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a virtual currency that has grown in popularity after its inception in 2008. BTC-USD is an internet communication network that makes using digital money, including digital payments, easy. It offers decentralized clearing of transactions and money supply. This study attempts to accurately anticipate the BTC-USD prices (Close) using data from September 2023 to September 2024, comprising 390 observations. Four machine learning models—Multi-layer Perceptron, Extreme Learning Machine, Neural Network AutoRegression, and Extreme-Gradient Boost—as well as four time series models—Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average, Auto-Regressive, Non-Parametric Auto-Regressive, and Simple Exponential Smoothing models—are used to achieve this end. Various hybrid models are then proposed utilizing these models, which are based on simple averaging of these models. The data-splitting technique, commonly used in comparative analysis, splits the data into training and testing data sets. Through comparison testing with training data sets consisting of 30%, 20%, and 10%, the present work demonstrated that the suggested hybrid model outperforms the individual approaches in terms of error metrics, such as the MAE, RMSE, MAPE, SMAPE, and direction accuracy, such as correlation and the MDA of BTC. Furthermore, the DM test is utilized in this study to measure the differences in model performance, and a graphical evaluation of the models is also provided. The practical implication of this study is that financial analysts have a tool (the proposed model) that can yield insightful information about potential investments. © 2024 by the authors.},

With equal weight assigned to both factors, money printing outweighs inflation, and money withdrawal outweighs deflation. The study design is to analyze how competition between one variable–supply and one fixed–supply currency impacts the player’s choice of currency. Applying the 1959–2021 US M2 money supply data and the 1635–2021 US inflation data, the player’s utility increases over time when assigning high weight to money printing/withdrawal and increases less or decreases overall when assigning high weight to inflation/deflation. With different player support for the two currencies, depending on each currency’s backing, convenience, confidentiality, transaction efficiency, financial stability, and security, replicator dynamics is used to determine the player’s volume fraction of transactions in each currency. Low, high, increasing, and decreasing support of a currency are analyzed. Each fraction may increase, decrease, be inverse U–shaped, U–shaped, and approach low or high levels over time. For example, high weight assigned to money printing may cause the player to eventually prefer the variable–supply currency unless the player supports the fixed–supply currency highly and increasingly. © 2022 by the authors.},

The proposed scheme not only can circulate all E-cash systems but also allows exchanging a large amount of the E-cash into some small amounts of E-cash. Therefore, anyone can keep the remainder money if he does not spend the whole amount of the E-cash in a trade. ©2008 IEEE.},

The proposed payment system is based on the ElGamal encryption scheme, the ElGamal signature scheme and the ElGamal blind signature protocol. We show that our transaction protocol is secure and efficient. We give the definitions of unlinkability and unforgeability of our security model and we prove that the proposed transaction protocol is unforgeable and satisfies the unlinkability property. We show that the proposed system is more efficient, in terms of the computation and communication cost, than the compared payment systems (Eslami et al. in Electron Commer Res Appl 10:59–66, 2011; Chen et al. in Electron Commer Res Appl 10:279–287, 2011; Liu et al. in Proceedings of second European PKI workshop: research and applications.

Also, the proposed e-cash system is useful for the electronic transactions when the connection between the bank and the merchant is not available during the payment protocol. This means a less bandwidth of the payment protocol and then increases the speed of the electronic transaction. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently relaunched Nigeria’s cashless policy initiative which seeks to reduce financial crime and tax avoidance, decrease cash dependency, advance the adoption of digital financial services (DFS), decrease the risks to the payment system and foster financial inclusion. This study aims to identify the unique challenges of going cashless in Nigeria, particularly in terms of infrastructural, exclusionary and cost implications of the policy on the average citizens. Design/methodology/approach: The author applies a doctrinal research methodology to identify and reflect on key challenges of the cashless policy from the economic, regulatory and transactional perspectives. Findings: The cashless policy initiative in Nigeria heralds value for financial integrity, financial policy regulation and user convenience. The mode of introduction, however, ushers in significant challenges and hardly considers Nigeria’s inadequate payment infrastructure, persistent financial exclusion, low levels of financial and digital literacy and capability, high cost of using DFS and pervasive proclivity for cash. As Nigerians adjust albeit inconveniently to the policy, the CBN can ameliorate the hardship by strengthening the payment infrastructure, particularly for digital payments, fostering consumer trust by safeguarding user funds and enabling consumer preferences. Research limitations/implications: Research materials include the national regulator’s policy documents and newspaper articles that have not been published in formal reports but non-the-less adequately mirror the policy intention of the CBN and the lived experiences of Nigerians. Practical implications: This study identifies the practical steps and regulatory measures that the CBN can take to improve acceptance and meaningful and sustainable adoption of the cashless policy by the majority of Nigerians. Social implications: The recommendations that are proffered provide some rich insights to inform regulatory direction for the CBN to seamlessly phase-in the cashless policy and consequently drive down financial exclusion in Nigeria. Originality/value: This study contributes to the policy discussion around the introduction of the cashless Nigeria project. The doctrinal research method highlights the policy intentions of the regulator in juxtaposition with lived experiences of Nigerians. This study offers recommendations to bolster financial inclusion, stability and integrity. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the deadline-constrained discrete time/cost trade-off problem with discounted cash flows in project scheduling optimization. Our objective is to optimize the net present value (NPV) of cash flows by selecting execution modes for activities while considering project deadlines. To address this problem, we propose an adapted model that combines the activity-on-node representation of the project network with the milestone activity payment system commonly used in real-world scenarios. This enhanced model accurately depicts project dynamics, enabling improved decision-making in NPV optimization. To solve the problem, we employ the generalized benders decomposition technique, which provides an exact solution approach to handle the computational complexity of the problem. Our approach introduces three types of feasibility cuts. The first type eliminates infeasible solutions by analyzing subproblem infeasibility. The second type enhances the generation of high-quality optimality cuts by iteratively introducing constraints to the master problem, utilizing dominated paths in the project network graph. Lastly, the third type targets the elimination of inferior infeasible solutions. Additionally, we generate a comprehensive dataset encompassing various scenarios and parameter ranges from existing literature. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for further research, with online accessibility and the latest solutions available for approximately 32,400 generated instances. Through our research, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution procedure compared to existing methods in the field. By considering the specific requirements of project scheduling with NPV optimization and project deadlines, our approach contributes to more effective project planning and decision-making in real-world contexts. © 2023},

	abstract = {An important but overlooked cost of payments in retailing is the cost on checkout cashiers. This paper examines the compensating wage differential that cashiers require to handle payments in cash. First, a multicountry panel data study shows that cashier wages increase with retail cash usage, which is consistent with cashiers requiring compensation to handle cash. Second, in a discrete choice experiment where supermarket cashiers chose between collecting card and cash payments, eight of 10 cashiers preferred card to cash. Among those who preferred card, the median cashier required a wage premium of S$37.50 (US$27) a month to handle cash. The premium was lower among cashiers who are local, less risk averse, and younger. Third, in a laboratory study, subjects traded off earnings against stress. With higher frequency of cash payments, high earners experienced greater physiological stress than low earners. Earnings also increased with abilities in arithmetic and coping with stress. Collectively, these studies show that cashiers require higher wages to handle cash payments, in part due to higher stress. We offer policy, managerial, and research implications for job design, payment systems, and workplace stress. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The digital PSP offers a digital wallet and payment services, but does not offer credit. In contrast, banks invest their deposits in lending activities, which implies that they may incur some costs of adjusting their liquidity needs when consumers make payments. I show that the adoption of the digital wallet for payments may sometimes increase the volume of payments by bank deposit transfers and the lending rate. This results from banks’ trade-off between lowering their costs of liquidity when consumers pay from their digital wallet and reducing the revenues they receive from bank transfer fees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on primary data from students, scholars, government employees, and self-employed private employees of the Nagaland state of India. The data were collected through a questionnaire. The questionnaire was standardised by using the item analysis and the items generating unfavourable t-statistics were removed. The basic data were analysed by using descriptive statistics followed by interpretation of the results. In addition to that, inferential statistics was also used for hypothesis testing. Findings: The majority of consumers were satisfied with the electronic payment option, according to the study's findings, which is encouraging for the country's lawmakers. However, consumers also make use of cash on a regular basis. Debit or credit cards are used by almost half of consumers for both in-person and online purchases.

	abstract = {The role of payment cards in modern economies can hardly be underrated. In 2013, debit and credit card transactions represented roughly half of all consumer payment transactions in Western Europe, and accounted for more than 45% of all payment transactions in the United States.2 The payment card industry has faced intense antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, partly in response to the merchants' recurrent complaints about high transaction fees. In the past, regulation has mainly targeted the fees imposed by payment card networks. For instance, the most commonly used regulatory instrument caps the "interchange fee," which is the payment made by the merchant's bank (called the acquirer) to the cardholder's bank (the issuer). This interchange fee in turn impacts the merchant fee, which has sparked the controversy in the first place. The last few years have witnessed a renewed interest in policies allowing merchants to differentiate price according to payment choice. Absent public regulation on the matter, payment systems (open systems such as Visa and MasterCard, but also closed systems such as Amex, PayPal, and Google Wallet) have prohibited merchants from levying surcharges on their own payment method (the so called "no surcharge rule"). Arguably, one natural alternative to traditional regulation of interchange fees is to let merchants price discriminate as a function of payment method, allowing them to pass through to consumers any excessive merchant fees. The primary object of this note is to shed light on this debate, and clarify how optimal regulation of cash discounts/card surcharges by merchants is related to traditional modes of regulation of merchant fees.},

	abstract = {Increasing expectancy for efficiency in the delivery of building projects and the adoption of lean production processes for construction has made the necessity for the development of an integrated system for cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and payments in the construction lifecycle important. Existing 5D BIM tools are used to estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of standardization in the use of model elements through the project lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined. According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of a cost estimation project. It was also revealed that 5D BIM improves project cost visualization and budget control. © 2024 The author(s).},

Others are already managing development projects (the European Union) and pilots (China). The various imperatives behind these initiatives are easy for private actors in these markets to overlook, which sometimes complicates private–public cooperation. However, digitally issued public money stands at the forefront of central bank innovation in the monetary space.

They are reacting to the unavoidable trend towards digitalization of financial activities with the objective of preserving stable and efficient payment and financial systems. Uruguay, for instance, has promoted the use of electronic payment instruments and tested in the real economy a central bank digital currency called e-Peso. Digitalization of payment systems would reduce transaction costs by (partially) replacing less efficient means of payment, e.g. paper-cash and checks. In this paper we find that the cost of using cash in Uruguay is approximately 0.61% of GDP. Interestingly, 98.1% of this cost is borne by the private sector: Banks and retailers 77.1% and households 21.0%. The cost of using checks is equivalent to 0.04% of GDP. Overall, replacing paper-cash and checks by other (electronic) means of payment would imply a transaction cost reduction for the private sector of the equivalent of up to 0.65% of GDP. © 2020 Marcelo Álvez et al., published by Sciendo 2020.},

Owing to the untraceability and unforgeability properties, electronic cash can protect the privacy of customers and guarantee security of payments in the transactions. This paper introduces a customer-efficient electronic cash protocol where each customer only needs to store 1 coin for w dollars and transmit 1 coin for a w-dollar payment. Compared with traditional electronic cash protocols, the proposed method greatly reduces not only the storage required for the customers, but the communication traffic in the payments as well. Furthermore, the computation cost of each customer in the payment stage is greatly reduced by more than 99% as compared with other storage efficient electronic cash protocols. The proposed protocol is quite suitable for situations where storage and computation capabilities are limited, such as smart-card or mobile environments. In addition, both the problem of money laundering and the unlimited-growth problem of the bank's database, which records all spent coins for double-spending checking, are also considered in the proposed protocol. Especially, our basic idea is independent of the underlying cryptographic primitives such that it can be implemented by any public-key encryption, symmetric encryption, digital signature, and partially blind signature scheme.},

We take advantage of a natural experiment whereby (non linear) foreign ATM fees in one specific bank became suddenly applicable at one point in time. We also use this experiment to evaluate the substitutions between foreign ATM withdrawals and other home ATM or desk withdrawals as well as with payments by card. Using panel data on accounts, we first estimate average treatment effects on the treated before carrying on with the estimation of a simple structural model. The latter procedure allows us to compute the counterfactual impacts of changing the schedule of foreign fees. Impacts are sizeable on bank profits and consumer welfare. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Economic growth and cash-less policy are examined in a causal relationship, adopting longitudinal data for non-cashbased banking before the cash-less policy and its impact on economic growth and non-cash-based banking after cash-less policy and its impact on economic growth. Ordinary least-squares multiple regression models were adopted for the study. To test for the impact of CBN cash-less policy on economic growth, we used the Chow (1960) test of structural change. The study found that cheque, point of sale (POS), web and mobile payments as an alternative to cash payments contribute significantly to economic growth. However, their contribution is more evidenced before the introduction of CBN cash-less policy than after the introduction. This may be as a result of the slow rate of growth in the economy stemming from the depreciation of the Naira and falling oil prices. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The goal is to develop a non-proprietary and plug-in-and-play multi-modal transport payment (i.e. cash, credit card, passes, and more importantly the contactless smartcard) portable solution for the financially troubled public transit systems in the United States. Our proposed design utilizes an HP iPAQ hx2795 PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with Bluetooth capability, an EXTECH S2500THS Bluetooth thermal printer/magnetic card reader, and an SDiD 1010 SD-interface contactless smartcard reader. As a result, the conductor will only need to carry the PDA device for ticket transactions; with the EXTECH s2500ths unit attached to the conductor's belt. The system has been demonstrated with effective applicability, usability and durability for today's transit systems. ©2008 IEEE.},

The study investigates separately corporate preferences for the means of payment and the financing sources for acquisitions, using multinomial logit and nested logit models. First, we find that different factors explain the payment and financing decisions. Second, the cash payment decision is best explained by the target’s relative size, greater tender offers, cross-border deals, and cash reserves.

The adoption among them is still in its nascent stage due to presence of various inhibitors. Using innovation resistance theory as underpinning theory, this pioneer study attempts to identify an exhaustive set of m-wallet adoption inhibitors among unorganised retailers and to analyse the complex inter-relationship among them. Total thirteen inhibitors are identified through an extensive literature review and discussion with unorganised retailers. Further, an integrated DEMATEL and ISM-MICMAC approach is used to assess the complex inter-linkage among inhibitors. DEMATEL results disclosed ‘preference for cash’ and ‘early adoption hesitation’ as effect barriers and rest other eleven as cause barriers. ISM results revealed complex inter-relationship among identified barriers through an eight level hierarchical interpretive model. Further, ISM is complemented by MICMAC analysis that segregated the inhibitors into four distinct quadrants namely autonomous, independent, linkage and dependent on the basis of their driving power and dependencies. The application of the hybrid approach used in this study is novel in the domain of mobile payments. Findings of the study provide useful insights for both academicians and practitioners. Academically, this study enriches literature on m-wallet adoption. Practically, this study offers useful insights to marketers for growth of m-wallet industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

	abstract = {In Korea, unlisted stock shares are accepted as payment for inheritance tax. In the case of insufficient cash, a taxpayer can pay the government with listed or unlisted stocks (hereinafter referred to as "tax payment in kind"). The drawback of this tax payment system is that receiving tax paid with stocks is subject to the valuation of the government and selling the stocks to an open market requires another valuation. The results of these two valuations show considerable differences, and, therefore, the selling price in the open market is very low. This study analyzes how taxpayers recognize the differences in the valuation results of these unlisted stocks and how the differences affect the pricing for repurchasing the stocks from the open market. Results show that high valuation of unlisted stocks in tax payment in kind drives buyers to lower the purchasing price in the open market. This finding implies a problem in the government's valuation method of unlisted stocks collected as tax. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {At present, the existing endorsed e-cash system has a low communication efficiency, and its fair exchange protocol employs inefficient cut-and-choose proofs. In addition, the centralized TTP (trusted third party) is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. So far, several related fair payment systems have been proposed. Unfortunately, some of them use cut-and-choose proofs, and the others adopt verifiable encryption schemes with security flaw. Inspired by the idea of self-blindable attribute-based credentials, a concrete DAA-A (direct anonymous attestation with attributes) scheme is constructed. Based on the new DAA-A scheme, an improved endorsed e-cash system is proposed, which achieves a high level of exculpability. In order to improve users' computational efficiency in the spending process, the set-membership proof by Arfaoui et al's is adopted, and the efficiency of user's signature of knowledge is also optimized with the technique of pre-computation. In order to bypass the expensive cut-and-choose proof, a new optimistic fair exchange sub-protocol supporting distributed TTPs is provided. Furthermore, if combined with the Golle-Mironov model, the new system also suits for the environment of outsourcing computing. Compared with the previous similar ones, the new system meets several desirable properties simultaneously, i.e., it supports multiple payments, and does not depend on cut-and-choose proofs and allows users to be stateless, etc. What's more, the fair exchange protocol of the new system considers the risk of denial-of-service attacks. © 2016, Science Press.

Credit and debit cards have proved to be popular alternatives to cash payments in retail transactions. However, this is merely due to the unavailability of a system that would provide a reasonable alternative to the threats posed in carrying them. We attempt to propose a system that provides a platform for cashless transactions based on reliability and usability features. The Reliable and Cashless Payment System (RCPS) entails the involvement of an accredited financial institution that invokes an element of trust essential to design of an effective payment system. In this paper we address the security flaws in modern payment systems and propose a model that would make possible payments without cash or credit cards.

As a result, we can read the main thermodynamic quantities in terms of monetary ones. In particular, we define for the credit market model a work term which is related to the impact of monetary policy on credit creation. Furthermore, with our formalism we recover and extend some results concerning the temperature of an economic system, previously presented in the literature by considering only the monetary base as a conserved quantity. Finally, we study the statistical ensemble for the Pareto distribution. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

One of the substantial initiators of m-commerce was the introduction of well function and reliable payment systems. The widespread use of mobile phones has given rise to a number of schemes to allow the purchase of goods from these mobile devices. At present, mostly mobile payment systems mainly employ symmetric cryptography or certificate-based public-key cryptography to solve their related security issues. However, the limitation of computational capability in mobile devices makes the public-key cryptography framework unable to fulfill the practical requirement. In this paper, we will propose an efficient and secure micro-payment protocol suited for mobile environment. The main goals we want to achieve are as follows: (1) The broker can authenticate the customer and merchant; (2) The customer can pay safely via his mobile phone account; (3) The merchant can confirm the proof of payment from the customer; (4) The merchant can confirm the integrity of Scrip; (5) The protocol needs lower communication and computation times.},

This paper proposes a combined method with qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative method is conducted in a group discussion with 49 consumers in Vietnam. The questionnaire is sent to 349 consumers by using the convenience sampling method. The reliability and validity of the instruments are fit and show high values to be used in the actual study. Analysis of structural equation modeling is conducted to identify the impact of the relationship between concepts. The results of the study also indicate that perceived security and perceived trust are mediator role in the effect of technical protection, transaction procedure, security statement, past experience, and perceived benefit on retention using EPS. The results also show that a strong definite link between perceived security, perceived trust, technical protection, and retention using the EPS.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We find that India is no exception .Reserve Bank in its Vision statement has set the objective to proactively promote electronic payments with an objective towards less cash society. The formation of National Payments Corporation (NPCI) in the year 2009 has set the stage for development of retail electronic payments which offers enormous opportunity to move towards cashless and less cash society. Using T test, with an objective to assess the contribution of NPCI, we find that significant difference exist in products such as electronic clearing, ECS (Debit), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), and Card Products when we compare the period after formation of NPCI and before formation of NPCI. Various innovative products, such as Immediate Payment Services (IMPS), National Automated Clearing House (NACH) and Prepaid Instruments (PPI), were launched after the formation of NPCI. There is enormous opportunity since the ratio of retail electronic clearing to systematically important payments such as Real Time Gross Settlement and CCIL grew from 1 percent in the year 2005-06 to 3 percent in the year 2013-14. © 2015 Dhananjay B, et al.},

	abstract = {In the field of digital payments, the pandemic has brought digitalisation to layers of society that would not have been reached for years or even decades. In our study, after defining the different electronic payment options, we compare four market surveys in Hungary to investigate the extent to which the respondents' knowledge of electronic payments has changed, and how the use of cash substitutes and payment habits have changed due to the forced digitalisation caused by the pandemic. The results of our survey show that significantly more Hungarian residents are familiar with electronic payment solutions than in 2019, but a significantly higher proportion of respondents still do not manage their finances online. Most people are used to paying with cash and therefore do not turn to modern payment solutions. The pandemic as a forcing factor and the response of central and state measures have led society to make a significant step towards greater use of digital payment systems in 2020, and in 2021, this trend is expected to stagnate, not to fall back to the pre-virus situation. We found that government interventions and campaigns to support the positive processes that have been set in motion could help digital solutions to spread. © 2022, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

These forms of money have novel properties that have not been studied extensively within the economics literature, but may ultimately determine which currencies prevail in the forthcoming era of currency competition.

Content becomes disengaged from fixed carriers, and flows freely through networks and devices. We already witnessed how music albums and cash money were replaced by MP3 files and digital payment. Now dematerialization has entered the world of books. Dematerialization of these artifacts enhances their flexibility and availability, but our interaction with them loses its physical richness and becomes mainly cognitive and abstract. Since we believe that digital products should appeal to cognitive and perceptual-motor skills, we consider this move towards cognition as a pitfall. In this paper, we illustrate how we educate our Industrial Design students at University of Antwerp to deal with dematerialization. We discuss a design project that forced the students to at first, design the interaction. Here, the emphasis was on movement and not the arte fact. Only after that, the students were asked to design the product. The results of this project show that this way of working leads to solutions that otherwise would remain unexplored.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper examines how individuals can be susceptible to payment biases in the context of digital payment behavior by utilizing the concept of mental accounting. Furthermore, the paper investigates the moderating effects of Digital Financial Literacy (DFL) on the relationship between payment methods and spending behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a survey-based approach to collect data from 503 individuals who use digital payment methods, utilizing purposive sampling from Pakistan. The collected data is analyzed using Smart-PLS 4 software to assess the direct impact of payment methods on spending behavior and the moderating influence of DFL. Findings: The research findings demonstrate that both digital and cash payments significantly affect spending behavior. However, digital payments have a more substantial impact on spending behavior compared to cash payments. The findings also show that DFL significantly positively moderates individual spending. The study validates the mental accounting perspective by evaluating the direct impact of payment methods on consumers' spending behavior. Practical implications: The findings have practical implications for policymakers, financial institutions, and educators. Policymakers can leverage the insights to design effective strategies that promote responsible spending behavior and enhance the adoption of digital payment methods. Financial institutions can design user-friendly platforms that cater to users' spending preferences, while educators can develop programs to enhance Digital Financial Literacy (DFL) among the public. Social implications: This study’s social implications lie in its potential to contribute to individuals' financial well-being by promoting responsible spending through digital payment methods. Enhanced financial literacy and informed spending decisions can lead to better financial management and ultimately contribute to societal financial stability. Originality/value: The study enriches the understanding of mental accounting, shedding light on how overspending behavior can manifest through digital payment channels. In addition, this research practically provides valuable insights into enhancing the adoption and financial literacy of digital payments among the public. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

That debate received additional fodder in 2010 with passage in the US of the Durbin Amendment, which targets debit card interchange fees. I assess the Durbin Amendment, testing the interchange fee cap it imposes against the "tourist test" proposed in the theoretical literature. I first calculate merchant incremental payment processing costs across payment instruments. While I find that debit card bank fees are higher than bank fees for other instruments, a comparison of other incremental costs softens that conclusion. With the cost estimates in hand, I then compare the interchange fee suggested by the "tourist test" with that set by the Durbin Amendment. The empirical assessment of the tourist test highlights the importance of the instrument whose costs are "avoided" - whether cash or check is used dramatically alters the test and indicates that an optimal one-sizefits- All interchange fee cap will be difficult to achieve.},

It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative technique, including in-depth semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was conducted using thematic analysis, incorporating both deductive categorisation and inductive coding to identify factors responsible for the non-adoption or discontinuation of DPS use. Findings: The findings are in the form of themes and sub-themes that were generated from the data analysis: digital divide (DD), which includes the digital access divide, digital capability divide and digital innovativeness divide; socio-demographic divide (SD), which includes education, geographical location, gender, age and income; psychological barriers, which include a lack of perceived ease of use, vulnerability to risks, technophobia and a lack of trust; and other barriers, which include a lack of awareness, a cash-dominated society and a lack of interoperability. Research limitations/implications: The factors identified in this research can be further validated and tested in future studies using quantitative data. This will enable stakeholders to better comprehend the impacts of these factors on DPS adoption or usage. Practical implications: The study’s practical implications are specifically relevant to the Union Territory (UT) administration of Ladakh, as there is a DD and an SD among different sections of the population of the UT of Ladakh. UT administrations must prioritise efforts to eliminate these divides. The implications for banks and DPS providers are that they should conduct financial literacy training about DPSs in remote rural areas and invest in developing user-friendly and simplified DPS user interfaces to improve relationships with DPS users and their long-term retention. Originality/value: The findings of this study reveal the three levels of the DD that determine DPS adoption or usage, which have not been discussed together in the literature in the DPS context and that must be addressed to expand DPS adoption, thus providing a more holistic view of the DD in the context of DPS. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Blind signature is useful in many e-commerce applications where user’s anonymity is the main concern. Since the Zhang et al., was the first to propose the identity based blind signature, many schemes based on bilinear pairing have been proposed. But the computational cost of pairing operation on elliptic curve is around 20 times the point multiplication on an elliptic curve. In order to save the running time, we present a new Identity-Based Blind Signature (ID-BS) scheme whose security is based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Performance comparison shows that proposed scheme reduces the cost of computation. Security analysis shows that proposed scheme is secure against the adversary and achieves the property of blindness and Non-forgeabillity.

	abstract = {The final stage of the changeover to the euro consisted of the introduction of euro coins and banknotes on 1 January, 2002. The national changeover plans, that provided the scenarios, were based on the exclusive transaction function of money. However, in most European countries high-denomination banknotes were significantly hoarded and/or used in the underground economy. Since the holders of these banknotes could not convert them anonymously in the two months changeover period, some feared that many banknotes would invade the payment system, leading to a cash-crash. Nevertheless the changeover process evolved smoothly. As for the future, chances are that some users in the regular sector have permanently changed their payment habits by shifting towards electronic means of payment. In the longer run we believe, however, that the tolerant attitude of the authorities with respect to currency use in the underground sector, will sustain the demand for currency. © MCP UP Limited.},

	abstract = {With the unfolding of the fourth industrial revolution, the combination of 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other technologies has become the basis for innovation in many industries. Within the financial operations of various industries, the payment services undergone vast changes after the application of new technology. With the popularity of smart phones, mobile payment has become the main payment method, gradually replacing cash payment and bank card payment. In order to ensure the security of the payment process, users need to enter a password for identity verification, and later for a more secure and convenient identity verification, biometric technology was introduced. In the recent years, with the in-depth integration of various technologies, a more convenient payment method has been produced, that is, the face recognition payment. Face recognition payment is a simple payment method based on the face recognition system. The user does not need cash, bank card and mobile phone when paying, and only needs to perform face recognition through the camera on the POS terminal to complete the payment. The whole process only takes a few seconds. Face recognition payment as a new payment method has attracted much attention. Many offline stores in China have cited this new type of payment. The first case of face recognition technology in China in 2020 has attracted the attention of the society. Although the face recognition market is developing rapidly, the laws and regulations related to it are not perfect. People have doubts about whether the collected facial information can be properly stored, and many people worry that face information can be collected without consent, and whether the personal information and privacy can be guaranteed in the future or not. The high cost is not the only reason that hinders the development of the face recognition market. Different customers will have different attitudes towards innovation. This article aims to study the impact of customer characteristics on innovation resistance and to explore the impact of innovation resistance on intention to use, which will help face recognition payment technology and products to better meet user needs, so as to achieve the effect of innovation diffusion. This article chose attitudes towards existing products, motivation, self-efficacy, innovation and perceived risk as customer characteristics. It conducted an online questionnaire survey on 123 Chinese users through the Chinese “WENJUANXING” online survey system, collected data through SPSS 22.0, and analyzed the said data using Smart PLS 2.0. © 2021, Success Culture Press.

	abstract = {In a world where the means of exchange is convertible into the numeraire consumption good at a fixed rate, no one wants to hold money over time – and due to convertibility there is no means by which the Friedman rule can generate deflation. This is the environment we study in this paper in order to demonstrate that there is still a way to reach the first-best: institutionalize the naked shorting of the unit of account, or in other words establish a banking system. To motivate the benefits of a banking system, the environment has real productivity shocks that are constantly changing the optimal level of economic activity, so the optimal quantity of money is inherently stochastic. Efficiency in such an environment requires the capacity to expand the money supply on an “as needed” basis. We show how a debt-based payments system that relies on banks to certify the individual debtors’ IOUs addresses the monetary problem. This model explains (i) central bank monetary policy as a means of stabilizing the banking system and (ii) usury laws as means of promoting equilibria that favor non-banks over those that favor banks. Furthermore, by modeling a commercial bank-based monetary system as an efficient solution to a payments problem this paper develops a theoretic framework that may be used to evaluate central bank digital currency proposals. © 2020, Rimini Centre for Economic Analysis.

	abstract = {The present paper provides an overview on current developments of cash usage and issue of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the euro area and proposes a possible design of a digital euro that allows for instant offline payments. Cash usage at the point-of-sale decreased perceptibly in the past years mainly due to the ongoing trend towards digitalization. However, we show that there are also indications that consumers were somewhat pushed into cashless payments by government regulations and supply-side restrictions by commercial banks. Nonetheless, overall demand for euro cash remained strong and even increased relative to GDP since the financial crisis in 2008. In this pro-cess, however, we observe a supply-driven shift towards lower banknote denominations. Central banks all over the world are intensively thinking about the potential issue of CBDC as a substitute or complement to cash. Based on some of its preferred characteris-tics, we propose a double pre-paid scheme combining central elements of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement and electronic money features enabling offline and online instant payments. Since anonymity is categorically discarded by the ECB and as cash has some special advantages from a consumer perspective, the digital euro will rather co-cir-culate with cash than replace it in transactions. © 2022, Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

Most models of cash–credit choice assume cash is a safe non-interest-bearing asset and credit is interest-bearing but costly. Here, I consider the risk of loss from using cash resulting from theft and foregone interest earnings. I use a cash-in-advance model to analyze the channel through which monetary policy could have a positive impact on the economy by altering the incentives for cash–credit choice. The model indicates that although expansionary monetary policy increases total consumption, the resulting substitution toward credit might increase transactions cost, which may not result in improving welfare. The net effect depends on the change in transactions cost of using credit relative to the responsiveness of theft to inflation. The assumption of fixed cost of credit is crucial to these results. Calibration of the model to the US and Polish economy confirms the results. © 2016 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois},

Examining mechanisms, we find a limited role for social networks and stronger support for learning by doing. Further, information frictions hinder the immediate adoption of digital payments.

	abstract = {The adoption of financial technology (fintech) has the potential to make banking and financial services more accessible and convenient for all, but there are significant barriers preventing the adoption of fintech by street vendors and hawkers in India. This study aims to identify and analyse the barriers to fintech adoption using interpretive structural modelling (ISM). The research identified nine key barriers to fintech adoption, including perceived risk, lack of trust, lack of perceived benefit, social influence, lack of awareness, cash culture, lack of literacy, perceived ease of use, and lack of financial literacy. The study utilizes ISM to develop a hierarchy of these barriers and their interrelationships. The findings suggest that to promote the adoption of fintech, it is essential to build trust and awareness of fintech services through education and outreach programs. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the barriers to fintech adoption among street vendors and hawkers in India and offers insights into how these barriers can be overcomed. The study contributes to the development of strategies that can help promote the adoption of fintech among marginalized populations and advance financial inclusion in India. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The adverse effect of late payment by employers or contractors and consultants is a common phenomenon and a costly problem in the construction industry. This paper examines the domino effect of the advance payment of contractors on project cash flow and company performance. This stems from the view held by scholars that smooth cash flow guarantees the efficient delivery of construction projects and is a basis for developing and maintaining a healthy and competitive construction industry. The study employs a systematic review of extant literature and a quantitative research approach. A questionnaire survey of construction firms listed in Grade 7 to 9 on the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Register of Contractors was conducted to acquire information required to address the research objective. Using this approach, the study first formulated a conceptual framework and hypothesised relationships illustrating the domino effect of the advance payment system (APS) on project cash flow and organisation performance based on literature review. The effect of the advance payment system and relationship between it, project cash flow and organisation performance were evaluated using a structured questionnaire. After that, the data collected were analysed using mean score and t-Test. The findings of this study indicated that APS has no effect on project cashflow and performance of organisations and projects, which negates the hypothesised relationships that were identified in the conceptual framework. The study concludes that the use of APS on projects is not widespread among South African contractors, explaining why the effect of APS on cash flow and organisation was non-significant as against the conclusions of past studies. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

The research proposes a synergistic cyber security model of the SEP of NBU, taking into account the securitization of the payment portfolio of banking institutions in the financial market to prevent threats and meet the needs of participants and users in banking services. The article analyzes the chronology of attacks on the information resources of the NBU and the banking system during the period of martial law in Ukraine, and presents fraudulent targeted attacks "using eidetic of banking institutions of Ukraine. The criteria for the level of cyber security of the SEP of NBU are recommended. The research concludes with a determination of the reference state bank of Ukraine, which has the best combination of the level of securitization of the payment portfolio of banking institutions and the protection of active information resources. The practical significance of this research lies in providing recommendations aimed at improving the stability of cyber security in the SEP of NBU, thereby ensuring the safety of cash transactions in the digital economy. © 2023 Economic Affairs (New Delhi).},

It explores the rotation of local judges as an exogenous shock that increases local judicial independence in China and analyses the impact of rotation on provincial cash inflow using data from China's high-value payment system. The difference-in-difference estimates indicate that the rotation of the judges can attract more outside cash inflow, including amount and average size. This effect persists even after controlling for the endogeneity concern and the effect of disaster. The results of the dynamic effects show that the impact of the rotation of the judges on cash inflow mostly originates in the second and third years after the rotation. We further find that judicial independence can promote more foreign direct investment, venture capital's investment, and bank loans and clarify the impacting mechanisms of judicial independence on cash inflow. © 2018 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2018},

	abstract = {Purpose–The purpose of this study is to understand turbulence in the field of payments in Europe and which future challenges this bring. The objective is to enable actors – industrial as well as policy-making agencies – to avoid becoming passive and reluctant to take needed steps that may realize a new playing field for payments.; Design/methodology/approach–The article uses scenario analysis methodology to propose a way forward if the field of payments is to move away from turbulence and instead embrace renewal. It is based on a literature study, interviews and workshops.; Findings–This article discusses and shows how the payment system is in a state of turbulence, which in itself, may become a self-reinforcing negative process. The seemingly rational competitive actions that firms take in this situation may make the situation worse. The article also outlines critical action that must be taken to avoid this negative process.; Research limitations/implications–There is a need for research that integrates studies on innovation and renewal in the critical industries – banking, telecom and the system driving industries – to improve our understanding of possible synergies and/or obstacles to integrated, cross-industry innovation efforts. Such insights may also lay the foundation for the creation of a way to overcome turbulence.; Practical implications–The article advocates the need that critical actors collaborate to develop a new understanding – or common ground – of a future payment system. This will serve as a tool to identify obstacles and challenges, develop action and formulate agendas for different actors in and around the system. Based on the new common ground, actors are then free to formulate their own strategic agendas in a new competitive landscape in the field of payments.; Social implications–If the turbulence is to be avoided, national governments in the euro area and the European Union Commission must work hard to avoid national exemptions and adaptations (often caused by strong lobbying by companies from each country in question). Innovation agencies must work so as to stimulate renewal. Another task could be to educate consumers on the social and economic benefits of moving away from a cash-based payment system.; Originality/value–The originality of this paper is to test the idea that turbulence and the consequential inertia in the payment system is a result of the institutional set-up of the industry. In addition, the article uses causal texture theory and scenario analysis to understand turbulence and inertia in the payment system. This has, to my knowledge, not been done before. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Despite efforts to shift toward digital payments, cash transactions remain prevalent, highlighting the need to explore m-wallet service adoption dynamics in Jordan. This study aims to identify the factors influencing Jordanian consumers’ adoption of m-wallet services, focusing on the motivations and barriers. Utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) as a theoretical foundation, the research integrates various models to assess technology acceptance. A questionnaire distributed among m-wallet users from fintech companies in Jordan garnered 421 responses, analyzed using the Smart PLS 3 software. The findings indicate a positive impact of all variables on the propensity for m-wallet adoption in Jordan. Notably, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and facilitating conditions significantly influenced user decisions, evidenced by R-square values of 0.78%, 0.758% and 0.684%, respectively. Meanwhile, perceived value, security, privacy, and social influence had a moderate effect. The attractiveness of alternatives and attitudes towards m-wallet usage showed lesser impact, with R-square values at 26.7% and 22.8%, respectively, illustrating varied influences on adoption rates in determining consumer adoption of m-wallet services in Jordan. This paper enhances research on mobile commerce in developing economies, focusing on Jordan. It explores the adoption of m-wallet services by fintech users, presenting a detailed model.

This study aims to identify proactive measures that can help promote and accelerate mobile payment adoption by examining the antecedents of consumers’ intention to use e-wallets at three stages: static, interaction, and transaction. The regression results from 1,147 consumers reveal that differentiating e-wallet usage into three functional services yields valuable insight. The UTAUT constructs are significant when explaining transactional functions, but only performance expectancy and social influence matter for static and interaction functions. Overall, comparative economic value (CEV) is more prevalent than UTAUT in explaining consumers’ intention to use e-wallets, while the role of perceived trust is inconclusive. The results suggest that policymakers should improve the regulations and legislation to enhance consumers’ trust to induce more e-wallet subscriptions and expedite the country’s transformation into a cashless economy.

It is also called electronic payment. The reduced transaction charges and the degree of ease of cash transfers associated with the electronic fund transfers and mobile banking will further drive the growth of digital payment systems in India. This paper highlights the growth of digital payment infrastructure in India and the problems faced by the sample respondents in connection with the operation of digital payment services. The researcher has collected data on Worldwide Mobile and Broadband Subscriptions and Government e-Payments Rankings along with the growth percentages as secondary source of data and primary data were collected from a sample of 100 respondents from Tirunelveli town of Tamilnadu. The survey results were interpreted with the help of Reliability Analysis, percentage analysis, Reliability analysis, Factor analysis and structural Equation Modelling through SPSS and AMOS software. The study reveals that though the sample respondents use digital payment services in various forms and various purposes, they too come across with the problems of infrastructure, awareness and operation. The structural equation model fits the purpose. If the penetration of digital payment services is entered into every nook and corner of the villages by the extension of internet facilities, it will become a user friendly source of operation to everyone across India irrespective of the rural and urban villages. The ultimate focus should be to keep the momentum going with more support from the government and innovations, safety and convenience from the players. ©BEIESP.},

	abstract = {Research background: In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tendency of bank customers to use mobile banking is increasing. This is primarily due to the perceived ease and benefits of its use and the subjective assessment of the level of security of such a system. The main goal will therefore be to create such a mobile banking system, which in the era of pandemics, in addition to an easy-to-use interface, will also offer increasingly advanced technological solutions that will provide the customer with a high level of security. In order to meet the expectations of customers, banks will continue to develop and improve the most popular channels of distribution of their services, which are undoubtedly payment cards. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to define and classify non-cash payment instruments on the Polish banking services market in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Research methodology: To examine the current situation prevailing in the payment card market, as well as the factors determining the development of non-cash payments and the direction of future changes in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The research used models of development tendency (trend), and then applied them to forecast changes that will take place on the payment cards market in Poland at the end of 2021 and in 2022. The analysis was carried out using the STATISTICA 13.3 program. Results: a payment card is one of the best options for obtaining cash and every year the traditional cash in the wallet is being displaced more and more by "plastic money". Novelty: Furthermore, technological advances will bring new solutions to the payment card market and at the same time the e-money market will develop.  © 2022 Anna Feruś, published by Sciendo.},

While the weekly forecasting model includes institutional and idiosyncratic factors to generate forecasts of currency in circulation which are crucial for efficient day-to-day liquidity management operations of the Reserve Bank, the monthly model incorporates both macroeconomic factors and technological innovations in the payment system to delineate the impact of digital payments on currency demand. The quarterly and annual models incorporate macroeconomic factors to understand the long-run determinants and short-run dynamics of currency demand. The key findings emerging from the study are: (i) currency in circulation shows weekly and monthly seasonality apart from exhibiting significant variations during festivals and elections; (ii) an increase in the number of digital (card) transactions dampens currency demand in the short-run; and (iii) the long-run income elasticity of currency in circulation is unity. © 2020, Reserve Bank of India.

	abstract = {The internet and other digital networks in the U.S. (and beyond) remain essentially an upgrade of the national telephone network built by AT&T over the first half of the twentieth century, and digital payment remains tethered to telephony at the level of infrastructure. Telephone history also continues to inform digital payment at the level of interface. Debit card readers feature a keypad nearly identical to those introduced (also by AT&T) to the dialling public a half-century ago on touch-tone telephones. In this essay I highlight the development of the touch-tone keypad as a transformative payment technology. There have been three great leaps forward in the history of telephone interface: the dial, the keypad and the touch screen. Each corresponds to a period of technological transformation in the telephone industry and society more broadly: the rotary dial and automation, touch-tone keypads and digitization, and touch screens and computerization. The successful careers of the dial and the keypad, especially when read in tandem, suggest that touch screens will alter the everyday economics of retail payment even more radically than its predecessors. I also describe a broader trajectory of digital naturalization, whereby telephone numbers have proliferated into a personal identification number, passwords and a plethora of personalized information. Payments increasingly circulate today as subsets of personal information within the vast sea of big data. Payment apps are demonstrating a capacity to reorganize retail transactions on a scale as vast as any technology since the cash register. The history of retail payment finds the point of sale heading from the till into shoppers’ pockets. As a result, consumers are increasingly shouldering the costs of purchasing, maintaining, upgrading and securing the technology used for everyday transactions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The article analyses development and current status of e-money payments systems in the main Asian financial centers: Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Firstly, the classification of electronic money systems is given, according to which IC chip-based systems of e-money prevail in all economies under consideration. A significant role in the development of e-money payments is played by the companies of public transportation and retail trading enterprises. Secondly, extent of development of electronic money in Asian financial centers is defined. The analysis of development of electronic payment systems in the Asian financial centers allowed to draw the following conclusions: 1) annual value and volume of e-money transactions per inhabitant is the highest in Hong Kong; 2) Singapore takes the first position in the world by the number of e-money instruments per inhabitant. Also, it has the world's highest share of electronic money in the total amount of non-cash payments; 3) Japan shows the highest total number of e-money instruments and the highest volume of annual transactions with the use of electronic money. The main reasons of wide use of electronic money in the financial centers of Asia are: 1) speed and convenience of payments of e-money; 2) possibility of universal use of electronic money. Thirdly, the author points at the main features of regulation of electronic money in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. In all economies under review it is carried out on the basis of a specialized piece of legislation. The most liberal model of regulation of e-money is seen in Singapore. Hong Kong has the most conservative legislation as a part of general policy of the national monetary and credit authorities on regulation of payment systems.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose Mobile commerce adoption is low in developing countries; hence, public servants may not consider mobile commerce and mobile payments. Understanding the factors that influence mobile commerce and mobile payments in their context will aid in promoting those services. Background The study investigates the factors that influence public servants’ mobile commerce and mobile payments in Ghana. Hence, it provides some understanding of the various aspects of mobile commerce and mobile payments adoption, such as acceptance, use, and eventual adoption into the user’s daily life, and how that affects their behaviour. Methodology The research was conducted by surveying the factors influencing public servants’ adoption of mobile commerce and payments in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to put the research model to the test to measure the constructs and their relationships. Contribution The study confirmed previous findings and created a new conceptual model for mobile commerce and mobile payment adoption and usage in the Ghanaian context. Findings The variables of performance expectancy, trust, and facilitating conditions have a significant positive influence on behavioural intention. The factors of effort expectation and social influence have a significant negative impact. Price value and perceived reliability are latent variables that do not affect behavioural intention. Behavioural intention and facilitating conditions significantly influence the actual use behaviour of mobile commerce and mobile payment users. Recommendations Mobile commerce is emerging as a new mode of transactions, with firms for Practitioners providing enabling platforms for users. Mobile commerce could become the most acceptable application for the next generation of mobile platform applications. This study offers insights into the fluidity of the mobile environment, with implications that spell out what will be effective mobile commerce services that will continue to be relevant. Mobile applications are attractive to people because they provide a better user experience. These mobile applications have been optimised to provide a fast, easy and delightful experience. Mobile commerce and mobile payment service providers can attract and retain more users if attention is paid to performance expectancy, trust, and facilitating conditions since they influence individuals’ decisions to adopt. Mobile technology is almost ubiquitous, influencing both online sales and in-store sales. With the right mobile commerce platform and features, businesses can expect to increase in-store and online sales, catering to a more extensive clientele. Mobile devices are the primary means that most customers use to look up information about products they see in stores, such as product reviews and pricing options. This study indicates that mobile commerce service providers can achieve a more extensive customer base by promoting performance expectancy, trust, and behavioural intentions. Recommendations Despite the numerous studies in the mobile commerce literature, few have used for Researchers integrated models of perceived reliability, trust, and price value or methods to evaluate these factors in the emerging mobile commerce industry. Also, it combines mobile commerce and mobile payments, which very few that we know of have done. Impact on Society Ghana is already in a cash-lite economy. Thus, the study is appropriate with the result of trust being a significant factor. It implies that people will begin using mobile commerce and mobile payments with a bit of drive to bring about this drive quickly. Future Research Future research could further test the adapted model with moderating factors of age, gender, and education to delve deeper into the complexities of mobile commerce and mobile payments. © 2022 Informing Science Institute.

We quantify and compare the trend of currency in circulation with main macroeconomic and demographic indicators and focus on finding and defining possible additional qualitative factors that might influence the usage of banknotes and coins. Paper offers a new approach to rising currency in circulation which is not based on quantitative factors but more on the qualitative factors which motivate users to use cash. Furthermore the paper focuses on the regional aspect and describes and compares the cash situation in the Czech Republic. Based on the defined qualitative factors, which are promoting the use of cash and motivating potential users of cash, we come to the conclusion that cash will play its important role in the future as a reliable, safe and user friendly mean of payment.},

Given, however, that people living in the euro area have been using various forms of digital payments for a number of years, a key question is what the benefits of such an innovation would be, aside from a reduced dependence on payment processors from outside the EU. A digital euro that retained the properties of physical cash, such as anonymity, offline payments and high inclusion, could provide added value compared with existing digital payment solutions. This paper explores whether and how fast-developing technology might be used to implement a cash-like digital euro. This type of resemblance to cash could eventually be more important for wide adoption than the difference in liability between central and commercial bank money. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

	abstract = {The assessment of consumer behavior regarding the choice of financial instruments may be extremely important in the near future, since the fight between cash and electronic money has reached a turning point, and electronic payments are slowly defeating cash. On one hand, in the long term, this possible separation threatens sustainable development goals, and on the other hand, financial awareness can affect the number of purchases and savings. In a survey of 499 people, we examined the reasons behind their decisions, with a particular focus on financial awareness. The result shows that the vast majority of Hungarian consumers are not yet ready to fully accept electronic payments. It can be stated that financial awareness is not present at all in one-fifth of respondents, and one-third are influenced by habituation in everyday shopping situations, which indicates a lack of financial awareness. Based on our results, we have concluded that our consumers still find it difficult to abandon cash payments. Financial awareness needs to be improved in parallel with the Hungarian government’s strategy to reduce the use of cash. © 2022 by the authors.},

After the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, along with the introduction of all-new cryptocurrencies and stable coins, even many central banks have voiced an interest in the introduction of digital currencies. Hence, the pros and cons of the new central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are the newest widely discussed topic. This paper focuses on the ways a new instrument, central bank digital currency (CBDC),is expected to improve the modern payment systems, increase the efficacy of monetary policy and ensure financial stability in the new era. The study concludes that although CBDCs might boost monetary policy effectiveness and financial stability, it is vital to reevaluate and thoroughly analyse the geopolitical, geoeconomic, and geostrategic implications and effects of having a CBDC. © 2022, SETA Foundation.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the regulations for digital payment policies that are assessed and amended based on any gaps regarding its penetration nationwide. The demonetization of the Indian banknotes led to the facilitation of various modes of digital payment. While adopting these modes, the citizens faced perils of surcharges, the inconvenience of non-real-time transactions, and stagnation of cash in the digital wallet without interest and more. Such as credit and debit cards requiring point of sale (PoS) terminals with high operational cost impeding their adoption for micro and small merchants. Hence, upon remonetization, a surge in cash usage was noticed because of the convenience of transparency it provides. The key policymakers such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY), and the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) aim to lead India towards a less-cash society and sustain digital payment adoption. The policies and regulations around digital payments should strive to provide access to user-friendly and cost-effective financial service mobile applications to empower both merchants and consumers with a stable digital payment infrastructure. To ease the challenge for users of having to experiment and choose from various modes of digital payments, the government has mandated unified payment interface (UPI) system that consolidates the digital payment experience to promote a low-cost QR code payment acceptance solution. The paper provides policy solutions by recommending policies to ease the adoption of digital payments for the financial inclusion of every citizen and its long-term sustenance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

Despite continued efforts to promote formal remittance channels, informal remittances flourish among specific population groups. This study uses data from the Canadian Study on International Money Transfers to analyze the determinants of remittance modality or channel choice. Previous empirical work tends to classify remittances as either formal or informal. In contrast, this article considers a variety of channels. It shows that the dichotomization of formal versus informal remittances masks crucial differences across remittance channels. Due to Canada's unique geographical positionality, cash transfers operate distinctly from informal methods despite often being treated as a homogenous group in other studies. Interestingly, remitters are also more likely to use formal money transfer operators (most of which offer cash pickup options to recipients) than informal channels to send funds to countries with larger informal sectors. Within the context of Canadian remittance outflows, this invalidates the frequent assumption that more informal destination country economies push remitters to opt for informal transfer methods. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Smart cards are employed in scenarios requiring heightened authentication and security, leveraging features such as passwords, cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption, and personal identification through biometric data like fingerprint or iris scans. They also facilitate digital currency transactions, where electronic cash is debited instantly, necessitating real money payment by the cardholder to complete the transaction. The success of smart cards depends on the security, transferability, and ability to maintain data integrity. However, ensuring the security of contactless payment systems presents challenges, including personal threats and various potential attacks that the system must defend against. This article aims to explore the security aspects of contactless payment systems, examining the importance of trust, security measures, and underlying technologies governing transaction processes in contactless payment cards and NFC-enabled mobile wallets. Additionally, it delves into the EMV and ISO standards for contactless payment, highlighting their limitations in bolstering the security and privacy of such transactions. These limitations can be exploited by adversaries to compromise the integrity of transactions, emphasizing the need for robust security measures. © 2024 IEEE.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has further promoted the adoption of mobile payment since it is faster and more hygienic than cash payment. However, empirical evidence is scarce on whether people would react differently when the transaction is made through mobile or cash payment. In this paper, we examine whether the payment method has an impact on prosocial decisions and risk attitudes using standard laboratory games such as the dictator game, the ultimatum game as well as the conventional Holt and Laury (2002) risk assessment. After controlling a rich set of demographic characteristics, including age and gender, we find subjects are more generous when they use mobile payment compared to cash, but the payment effect on risk attitude is not evident. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Due to the limited resources that they may have, it is necessary to conduct a careful study in all stages of development, which include the decision to choose a means or several means of payment for your e-commerce platform. This paper presents a comparative study between three payment methods used in e-commerce: Internet Banking Payment Gateway (IBPG), payment gateways, and cash deposits, which are studied from the perspectives of the functionalities offered and the requirements of technological architecture demanded, the economic aspect and the advantages and limitations. The results show IBPG is the alternative that offers all the functionalities presented in this article, on the other hand, its rates are the highest as well as its technological requirements. Whereas payment gateways do not cover all the functionalities and each one of them presents a different combination between these attributes. Likewise, the cost of its implementation offers a wide range of prices, which vary depending on the level of security, real-time processing, multi-currency payments, anti-fraud control, and data protection. Moreover, its requirements are lower than for IBPG. Finally, the option of cash deposits is presented as a traditional alternative that focuses on real-time processing; and it still concentrates a high percentage in e-commerce payment transactions, whether it be payment gateways and cash payments, the most convenient and economical alternatives to initiate charges for a product or service.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The study sought to test the effect of financial technology on money demand in selected African states. The study drew from the fact that there is significant latent demand for digital payments in many markets of sub-Saharan Africa, and widespread consumer acceptance of mobile-communications technology is highly encouraging. The study sought to examine the effect of technology, among other things, on money demand. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used panel data and a GMM panel technique to analyse the study's findings. Findings: Results showed that all variables that captured financial technology have a negative effect with money demand (MD). Both Mobile Subscriptions (MS) and ATM (Automated Teller Machines) have a negative relationship with money demand (MD). Practical implications: Based on the results obtained in this study, the study recommended that Central Banks need to monitor and predict the consequences of financial innovations. As African states proceed with reforms of its financial sector, the stability of the demand for money would have to be reexamined and instruments of the Central Bank modified to ensure an effective control of money demand. Originality/Value: A little has been done on the effect of technological developments on money demand in Africa. An understanding of the way technological developments may positively or negatively impact on money demand may guide Central banks in adopting and implementing appropriate monetary policies and actions. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

	abstract = {Risks of payment system of banking institutions of Ukraine are considered in this study. Risk events clearly correlate to the effectiveness of network interaction of banking institutions to adapt information technology of payment systems in the payment portfolio of banks when changing operating environment, so mechanism for minimizing their probability has been developed. Economic elements of the mechanism of minimizing the risks of payment systems are identified, which allow forming the planned level of profitability, risk and liquidity of institutions (organizations) within the relevant principles, methods, levers, cash flows in order to respond and adapt to changes in the environment. A methodical approach to assessing the effectiveness of risk management of payment systems of banking institutions, which is from the standpoint of multivariate structuring and a list of their indicators of the microeconomic level, forms an optimal set of tools to minimize the set of risks. Indicators of payment systems of Ukraine are determined, according to the net level of credit risk, liquidity risk, business risk, investment risk, legal risk, operational risk, systemic risk, technological and information security risk. The impulse index of functioning of payment systems of Ukraine is calculated. A neuro-fuzzy model for assessing the individual credit risk of participants – legal entities (users-borrowers) of card payment scoring of a banking institution is developed. The basic criteria for assessing the individual credit risk of a participant-legal entity (user-borrower) by card payment scoring are determined. Copyright©2021 by authors},

I focus here on payments being halted and deferred because of U.S. embargo restrictions that prevent correspondent relationships with Cuban retail banks and constantly flag transactions initiated in Cuba. Cubans and visitors to Cuba operating on these digital platforms are therefore exposed to new risks and forms of precarity. In the absence of a robust payment infrastructure, electronic transactions between the two countries have to be propped up and secured by networks of cash circulation. A social infrastructure of trust and informal networks emerges through which digital payment rails get repurposed to settle accounts, particularly when electronic payments get detained. This complicates the premise that cashless futures make payments more inclusive, efficient, secure, or in some cases decentralized, by showing how the histories of U.S. sanctions impede and cripple the ways electronic payment infrastructures work in practice, creating forms of exclusion for those located in “prohibited” regions of the globe. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.},

Through investigation and analysis, we determine four means to deal with decommissioned ATMs, and construct thereafter an ATM reverse logistics (RL_ATMs) network model, which includes suppliers, producers, warehouses, operators, maintenance centers, collection and inspection centers, disposal centers, remanufacturing centers, and recycling centers. This model is further expressed as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Given that an ATM recycling network has planned and batched characteristics, a percentage diversion method is proposed to transform a real multi‐cycle problem to a single‐cycle problem. The RL_ATMs network constructed in this study presents the two forms of ATMs, functional modules and the entire machine. We used the actual situations of the related companies and enterprises in Anhui Province and its surrounding areas, as well as major banks’ ATMs, as bases in using the LINGO software to solve the proposed MILP model with the objective function of minimizing costs and environmental emissions, and obtain the relevant companies’ launch operations. Lastly, we analyzed the relationship between coefficients in the percentage diversion method and calculation results, cost, and carbon emissions. Accordingly, we find that the number of remanufacturing and maintenance centers has no evident impact on the objective function, transportation costs account for a large proportion of the total cost, and emissions tax is small. © 2021 by the authors.

The events of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that have been performed from all merger-involved firms listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in the period from 2005 to 2007 are evaluated using accounting data (financial ratios), and from them the final sample of the study that is finally investigated consists from thirty five Greek firms, which executed one merger or acquisition in the period from 2005 to 2007 as acquirers and have not performed any other important acquiring decision in a three-year-period before or after the examined M&As transactions. For the purpose of the study, a set of sixteen ratios is employed, in order to measure firms’ post-merger performance and to compare pre-and post-merger performance for three years (or two years or one year) before and after the M&As announcements (with data analysis from 2002 to 2010). Furthermore the impact of the means of payment, of international or domestic M&As and of conglomerate or non-conglomerate mergers are evaluated. The results revealed that mergers have not any impact on the post-merger performance of the acquiring firms. Thus, the final conclusion that conducted is that the M&As activities of the Greek listed firms of this research have not lead them to enhanced post-merger accounting performance. Last, from the research results, it is clear that there is no difference from the mean of payment (cash or stock exchange) on the post-merger performance at the acquiring firms, and there is a better performance for international and conglomerate M&As. © 2014, Virtus Interpress.

In the Philippines, preliminary analysis indicates some substitution from cash to digital payments, albeit not on a large scale yet. While the remarkable inroads in retail payments digitalization and demographics are expected to bring about a behavioral shift in cash usage, the pace and extent of substitution are contingent on policy reforms aimed at widening access to affordable digital payment services, secure digital infrastructure, and privacy protection, among others. More granular data would help inform strategies for equitable and safe payment choices, enabling consumers to securely access and freely choose from diverse and affordable payment options that suit their needs. Thus, it is vital for cash and digital payment infrastructures to adapt and uphold consumer payment choice. © 2024, Philippine Economic Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have the potential to increase the financial reliability of digital payment systems by offering direct interactions between payment system participants, including institutional and private ones. To unfold the potential of CBDCs, CBDC systems need to offer confidential payments to protect participants from surveillance. However, confidential payments lay at odds with requirements for transparency of payments in CBDC systems to enforce regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations. This work presents HybCBDC, a CBDC system design that tackles the tension between confidential payments and the enforceability of regulations. We iteratively refined HybCBDC in three rounds of focus group interviews with finance and industry experts. HybCBDC offers cash-like confidential payments and means to enforce regulations. HybCBDC builds on a hybrid access model for using monetary items of a CBDC and combines an account-based and an unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based subsystem to record payments. The main purpose of this work is to support the design of CBDC systems that can tackle the tension between offering payments with cash-like confidentiality while allowing for enforcement of regulations related to AML and CFT.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The period from the 1950s to the late 1970s saw an almost uniform decline of cash-to-GDP ratios in industrial countries. A closer look at the German payment system suggests that the factor causing such a change was a shift towards cashless wage payments. In this period, in Germany, the branch network of banks expanded significantly and at the end of the period almost all economically active individuals had a current account. This change was triggered by rising wages and income. Rising wages increased the burden of weekly wage payments in cash, and rising income made the average earner more attractive for banks. Moreover, regulation and deregulation, by triggering both price and non-price competition, may also have played a role. Technological change was not an independent driver. In the 1950s, the number of giro accounts per German adult was comparable to the current situation in many developing countries. Yet, I argue that the German post-war experience does not provide a blueprint for most of these countries. © 2017 European Association for Banking and Financial History e.V.},

	abstract = {The “digital divide” is widely acknowledged as exacerbating inequality by leaving some people on one side or the other of a knowledge divide without access to appropriate tools for the future and all the opportunities that digital technology promises. Attempts to understand this gap tend to focus on issues of trust, levels of financial education, and digital skills, mainly seeking to understand why some individuals and groups—who are mostly assumed to have minimal financial know-how and digital skills—do not trust either online financial institutions or exclusively app‐based finance. Considering the large investment in fintech solutions driven by these industries, and the practical features designed in part to make the user’s life easier and user experience more intuitive and reassuring, it is worth noting that such queries are inclined to conclude that these untapped users cannot imagine a digital future due to their own lack of digital skills and lack of expos-ure to tech. This article suggests that, for a portion of this population, many of whom are digital natives, this is not the case. instead, they can invest in understanding and adapting to technology and do so. Yet they are uncomfortable with the “instantaneousness” of some transactions because this doesn’t allow them enough time to address a problem or have recourse for anything unforeseeable. Furthermore, their interest in fintech’s inclusive platforms is foreshadowed by their vivid futurist understandings and imaginations. Indeed, they envision precisely the kind of digital significance that is often assumed that they do not. However, this article argues that the key difference is that many envision the future as a digital dystopia and are resisting what Lauren Berlant refers to as “cruel optimism.” These types of imaginings motivate many to resist the vulnerabilities that they believe can make them overly dependent on technology in ways that they believe can potentially place them at risk. This article focuses on the US multi‐bank‐owned Zelle payment system and its online and app‐based banking features as a case study to illustrate these points. It further argues that the inclusivity that online digital banking platforms aspiringly offer is often viewed by potential users not as a portal toward equality but rather as “a leap of faith” toward digital dependency and future vulnerability. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).},

The purpose of the paper is to establish interdependence and explain the nature of changing situations in the market of bank payment cards (BPC) taking into account the dynamics of economic development parameters in non-financial sectors of the Ukrainian economy. The methodology of the study includes graphic methods analyzing the dynamics of economic development indicators and a method for analyzing the cause-and-effect relationship between the studied parameters considered with different lags. Results showed that the most significant parameters for the development of the payment card infrastructure were the level of provision with POS terminals and the share of non-cash transactions. Their correlation with the economic development indicators reached 0.97. Up to the stage when the volume of non-cash payments by cards reached 5% of GDP, the impact of the BPC market on the change in the level of economic development had been insignificant according to the general idea. The development of the economy up to that point stimulated the development of the BPC market. Subsequently, the BPC market that was already sufficiently developed became one of the drivers aimed at the development of non-financial sectors of the Ukrainian economy after overcoming the 5% GDP level. © Aleksey Mints, Оleh Kolodiziev, Mykhailo Krupka, Bohdana Vyshyvana, Lesya Yastrubetska, 2022.},

	abstract = {All activities carried out by the community are now influenced by digital processes. including online payment activities or the term e-money. The growth of e-wallet is driven by many developments in payment systems that can replace the presence of cash as a means of payment into non-cash payments that are more efficient and effective. This explains that there is a changing lifestyle in society in the digital era, using a cashless system more. E-money transactions increased during PSBB. One of the e-wallet that is now widely used by the public is OVO. This study was conducted with the aim of knowing how the effect of perceived convenience, perceived benefits, and perceived security on interest in using OVO in Central Java. The researcher uses a research that uses descriptive and causal types with a quantitative approach and uses a non-probability sampling data collection method with a purposive sampling type. The number of samples used in this study were 400 respondents. The data analysis method used is path analysis, data analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.1.

This research was carried out in Southeast Sulawesi Province which was divided into several clusters in Buton Regency, South Buton Regency, Central Buton Regency, Baubau City and Muna Regency, which was conducted in April to July 2019. Determination of the research area was purposive using cluster sampling techniques. The determination of this area is based on the fact that the five regencies/cities are producing organic cashew nuts because they do not fertilize and spray using pesticides. Market behavior was analyzed descriptively qualitatively by observation and interview methods. The number of informants is 437 people from 821 population. Market behavior reviewed includes: (a) Payment system, (b) Determination of prices shows the conditions of price determination at the time of the transaction, (c) Cooperation of marketing institutions. The results of the research show that market behavior is shown in every activity of marketing functions by carrying out activities such as drying, sorting and grading, financing, by establishing cooperation that is built on mutual trust in terms of providing capital, fulfilling the supply of cashews, shipping cashews together, determining prices based on market mechanisms, cost analysis, number of requests and offers by applying a cash, partial, initial and debt payment system. The dominant determinant of prices is traders not farmers although there is a bargain between farmers and traders and prices that occur based on prices that occur in the market and cashew farmers know about market prices available through the farmer's own network, so that the position of farmers is only as a price recipient (price taker) is not a price maker. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {This article is based on a study that aims to analyze factors influencing the acceptance of contactless payment devices by customers in Germany. Its purpose is to explain the influence of similar technologies, already in use towards the acceptance of contactless payment technology. Smartphones, especially the I-phone as one device of mobile technology, is offering a mobile payment procedure named Apple Pay. Contactless payment technologies are developing away from physically present credit card shaped plastic cards by an integration into mobile phone devices. Interviews in personal contact on petrol stations in Hamburg, Germany, have been conducted. Petrol stations are typically points of sale with a high rate of non-cash payments and customers have time to answer questions for an interview during refuting. 48 hours of interviews have been collected on two petrol stations in one of Germany’s largest cities, interviewing typical business-customers on a Monday and private customers on the weekend. The technology acceptance model has been chosen to identify and explain the interaction in the customer’s perception of new payment devices. The study reveals that the influence of information on the new payment process and possession of a customer loyalty card are critical variables in the customer acceptance of payment devices. Information about the new payment method proves to be the argument with strongest impact on the acceptance by customers. Besides these variables, perceived usefulness of the technology has been found as a significant factor in affecting the acceptance of contactless payment processes. Apples I-Phone with its current market penetration has the potential to provide a widespread and well known concept as basis for contactless payment technology. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

	abstract = {Purpose: While the potential for digital innovation (DI) to transform organizational practices is widely acknowledged in the information systems (IS) literature, there is very limited understanding on the socio-political nature of institutional interactions that determine DI and affect organizational practices in social cash organizations. Drawing on the neo-institutionalist vision, the purpose of the study is to examine the unique set of institutional exchanges that influence the transition to digital social cash payments that give rise to new institutional arrangements in social cash organizations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on an in-depth case study of a government social cash organization in Pakistan. Qualitative data were collected using 30 semi-structured interviews from key organizational members and stakeholders. Findings: The results suggest that DI is determined by the novel intersections between the coercive (techno-economic, regulatory), normative (socio-organizational), mimetic (international) and covert power (political) forces. Hence, DI is not a technologically deterministic output, but rather a complex socio-political process enacted through dialogue, negotiation and conflict between institutional actors. Technology is socially embedded through the process of institutionalization that is coupled by the deinstitutionalization of established organizational practices for progressive transformation. Research limitations/implications: The research has implications for government social cash organizations especially in the Global South. Empirically, the authors gained rare access to, and support from a government-backed social cash organization in Pakistan (an understudied country in the Global South), which made the data and the consequent analyses even invaluable. This made the empirical contribution within this geographical setting even more worthy, since this case study has received little attention from indigenous scholars in the past. The empirical findings showcased a unique set of contextual factors that were subject to BISP and interpreted through an account of socio-cultural sensitivities. Practical implications: The paper provides practical implications for policymakers and practitioners, emphasizing the need to address institutional challenges, including covert power, during the implementation of digitalization projects in the public sector. The paper has certain potential for inspiring future e-government related (or public sector focused) studies. The paper may guide both private and government policy-makers and practitioners in presenting how to overcome certain institutional challenges while planning and implementing large scale multi-stakeholder digitization projects in similar country contexts. So while there is scope of linking the digitization of public sector organizations to anti-corruption measures in other Global South countries, the paper may not be that straightforward with the private sector involvement. Social implications: The paper offers rich social insights on the institutional interchanges that occur between the social actors for the innovation of technology. Especially, the paper highlights the social-embeddedness nature of technology that underpins the institutionalization of new organizational practices. These have implications on how DI is viewed as a socio-political process of change. Originality/value: This study contributes to neo-institutional theory by theorizing covert power as a political force that complements the neo-institutional framework. This force is subtle but also resistive for some political actors as the force shifts the equilibrium of power between different institutional actors. Furthermore, the paper presents the social and practical implications that guide policymakers and practitioners by taking into consideration the unique institutional challenges, such as covert power, while implementing large scale digital projects in the social cash sector. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Emerging digital payment services, also known as Fin- Tech, have enabled various types of advanced payment transactions (such as Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, etc.). However, offline peerto- peer cash transactions still make up about 25.6% of the overall financial transactions in everyday life. By investigating existing online and offline payment systems, we identify three key challenges for building a digital cash transaction system with core features of the offline cash transactions: self-verifiability of digital cash; user anonymity; atomic cash transfer for double spending/depositing protection. In this paper, we propose OPERA, an offline peer-to-peer digital cash transaction system that addresses the three challenges. It newly introduces a concept of 'one-time-readable memory( ORM)' and 'digital token' which is a unit of self-verifiable digital cash. The one-time readability from ORM and three-stage token exchange protocol enable OPERA to provide uniqueness to digital cash and to allow a complete offline digital payment. OPERA devices are enhanced with TCPA technology to ensure the integrity of the physical device package. To evaluate the feasibility and resilience of the OPERA design, we built a prototype on a customized embedded board.

Payment system efficiency is a top driver for digital currency adoption. We examine literature gaps for payment ecosystem impact for adoption and design and conduct a test for 65 World Bank countries. We assess payment alternatives and preference impacts and estimate least squares and limited dependent variables regressions based on cross-national data. CBDC adoption is driven by payment ecosystems, alternative payment characteristics, e-money usage, perceived security, and infrastructure. This signals that user familiarity with digital payments, trust in authorities, and structural capabilities support adoption. It also is inversely related to alternatives that dampen the need for CBDC. Transaction volume and trust in authorities are linked to choosing a central database instead of a digital ledger technology infrastructure. Deviations occur due to ambiguous effects of cash and ledger technology usage for CBDC adoption and industry concentration, architecture, and systems linkages. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

	abstract = {A significant increase in the cash value of Bitcoin in the beginning of 2017 led to growth in people's interest in cryptocurrency. The uniqueness of this type of money is that the transaction occurs only with the approval of a network of participants, and the funds themselves are beyond the control of any state. At the same time, the Russian government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, did not approve a cryptocurrency until 2018. Despite the large number of studies that reveal the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency, as well as the motivation of the participants, the issue of building trust in cryptocurrencies remains relevant. The main goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms of trust building among the participants of the cryptocurrency market. The research information base was based on 15 semi-structured interviews with active participants of the cryptocurrency market. Based on collected data, a typology of cryptocurrency users was made, and ways of managing risks in interacting with the market and insight into the role of the state in this market were examined. Cryptocurrency users can be divided into those who use it for consumption of various goods (including those who are prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation) and those who seek to derive financial benefit from the current market situation. Although both groups exist in the same market, they have different expectations: consumers strive to ensure that the cryptocurrency exchange rate remains stable, whereas the other group hopes for a long period of high exchange-rate volatility to increase their own earnings. The position that the local state should take is an important factor of trust for each of the groups represented. Cryptocurrencies are still at an early stage of development. A large group of people on the market is trying to monetize the weaknesses that exist at the moment. Over time, the situation on the cryptocurrency market stabilizes, and it can then move to a qualitatively different stage of development. © 2018 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

	abstract = {Digital currencies are impacting the financial lives of people and countries around the world; particularly developing countries see the retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as an opportunity to increase financial inclusion and introduce new monetary policy implementation mechanisms. The decision to launch a digital currency mainly depends upon the goals and objectives being set by the Central Bank of any respective country. Digital currencies help to implement monetary policy more effectively to achieve the financial system stability. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the Commonwealth of Independent States region; the digital payments market is changing rapidly in Kazakhstan, being driven by fintech innovations and public investments in payment technologies. In this article, we thoroughly discussed how launching of “Digital Tenge” is promoting financial inclusion and strengthening the monetary regulations across Kazakhstan. We took the case of Kazakhstan because it’s the first country from Central Asia which took the initiative of launching digital currency, and the National Bank of Kazakhstan has already announced that implementation of “Digital Tenge” would be completed in Kazakhstan by the end of 2025. The implementation of a “Digital Tenge” as a CBDC in Kazakhstan would expand the range of financial services being available to the nation. Having direct authority over the digital currency will empower the National Bank of Kazakhstan to adopt more efficient monetary policy, exerting influence over interest rates, money supply, and general economic stability. Furthermore, by providing digital financial services to marginalized communities, the digital Tenge would also help to solve the difficulties of financial inclusion in Kazakhstan. The article provides the possible policy routes for the governments of developing countries and the financial regulators about adopting CBDCs for promoting financial inclusion and to strengthen the monetary regulations. © 2024 by author(s).

	abstract = {From being primarily a cash-obsessed economy, India’s digital payment story is new but exciting. Driven by progressive regulatory policies and increased use of mobile internet, Indian payment industry is going through a transformational phase. Digital Payments is nothing but the transfer of money between the two Bank Accounts or Mobile Wallets in digitalized form. There is no involvement of physical cash transaction. This paper is an attempt to analyze the Payment System Indicators such as Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (SIFMIs), Paper Clearing, Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments were taken for study for a period from 2007-08 to 2018-19. The indicators were analysed through trend analysis, correlation and regression analysis, ANOVA, mean, standard deviation, regression equation and t test. The study reveals that there is tremendous increase in the indicators like Payment System Indicators such as Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (SI FMIs), Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments and a decline in Paper Clearing and the results are statistically si gnificant. The regression model derived is good and significant and as per Regression Model Summary, the correlation (r) is positive and high to the tune of 0.962 and the explai ned variance (R2) is 92.6 percent. The model is sloping upwards in cases of the payment indicators Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures, Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments while the trend is sloping downwards for Paper Clearing. Hence it is strongly assessed that the di gital payment has its strong role to play in the eradication of paper clearing services in banking transactions. It is suggested that the focus should be to keep the momentum going with more support from the government and innovations, safety and convenience from the players. Â© IJSTR 2019.},

We provide both by extending the Zerocash zk-SNARK based approach and adding functionality that allows for customer due diligence 'at the gate'.

	abstract = {This article describes and analyzes the Euro cash changeover process. The European Monetary Union, EMU, is a unique event in history, although other monetary unions were formed and existed long before. Still, this giant experiment makes it possible to study changes in the monetary environment from a unique and new position. The article tries to find factors that can help to explain the different pace of transition between the countries participating in the third stage of the EMU. Even though it was common knowledge that the national currency would lose its status as legal tender at a predetermined point in time, the speed of acceptance of the new monetary standard could not be directly controlled by the relevant authorities. Hence, the whole changeover process was formed as much by the authorities as by the public. The paper focuses on four types of factors that may help to explain the differences in the pace of transition pattern between the countries: network related reasons, technical and logistic reasons, characteristics of the financial and payment systems and psychological reasons. It is found that the initial supply of Euro bank notes (so-called frontloading), the size of the population of the country, the length of the period when the national currency and Euro bank notes were used side by side, and the number of bank branches (per capita) together can help to explain a large part of the variation in the pace of adoption of the new monetary standard across the countries. The first two of these factors support the idea that currency is a network good. Psychological factors, such as nationalism, have not been found to significantly influence the outcome.},

	abstract = {The basic idea of quantum secret sharing is to share classical information through quantum schemes. In reality, the number of secret bits shared will vary according to the actual situation. For this reason, a secret sharing scheme of double qubits is constructed based on single particle. At the same time, combined with the needs of real life in e-commerce, this paper proposes a quantum blind signature protocol suitable for electronic cash payment scenarios. In this protocol, the blinding of the message is an XOR operation, which makes the solution simpler and easier to implement, and the owner of the message cannot be tracked. Moreover, we use quantum key distribution protocol and quantum one-time pad to guarantee its unconditional security. The quantum blind signature applied to the electronic payment system proposed in this paper could protect user’s anonymity as the traditional E-payment systems do, and also have unconditional security which the classical E-payment systems cannot provide. Security analysis shows that our scheme is unforgeability, undeniability, blindness and unconditionally secure. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

More than 4,000 transactions were gauged. It is empirically proven that cash is still the fastest means of executing transactions at the counter, although new innovative payment methods such as proximity cards and NFC mobile payments may be equally fast and sometimes even faster. There is a potential in accelerating the payment process of those latter. Standard cards together with a remote mobile payments method tested lag behind.

	abstract = {The payment scheme of Fabric 2.0 alpha is threatened by counterfeit tokens and its users are client apps, not the end consumers. In this paper, a uniform payment system is designed with the following advantages. (1). By limiting the token-minting right to a designated token-minting bank and the design of label, our system prevents the counterfeit token problem. (2). A complete transaction is divided into Bitcoin-level part and Fabric-level part. The Bitcoin-level part constructs inputs and outputs and signs these inputs, outputs and a nonce with a private key. This makes a micro enterprises or an end consumer can enjoy the payment service as the Bitcoin-level operation can be implemented on a mobile phone. The double-spending problem is prevented by the Fabric-level mechanism. (3). The system is easy to expand. When there is a new payment application, only one sub-function is added to the payment contract to implement the payment application, and a call to the sub-function is added. (4). Compared with Bitcoin, the unlockcode of UTXO only needs to be stored once, instead of being stored with each UTXO, thus reducing the sizes of transactions. As an application, based on the uniform payment system, we design an application of cash-on-delivery without any trusted third party. It provides technology support for any two persons to trade without any trusted third party. Similar to the payment system, a system for asset confirmation, asset transfer and redemption is designed. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In daily life, ordinary cash is more and more replaced by electronic means of payment. Where on the one hand side macro payment systems are well covered by credit cards, micro payment systems still suffer from different technological and usability issues. Besides usability, security in payment systems has always been a hot topic ever since. In this paper we present a new, promising approach for a purse-based micro payment system. Our system relies on a prepaid wallet having the money stored in a secure chip in the mobile phone. The proximity technology Near Field Communication (NFC) is used to conduct contactless payment transactions at the point of sale (POS). Additionally the wallet can be topped up over the air (OTA), anywhere and anytime. The combination of OTA top-up and NFC payment transactions make this system very convenient as the data acquired during an eight month trial shows. Users benefit from the system as they do need to head for an AT M to load money into the wallet. This system is also advantageous for banks and payment providers as there is no need to issue smartcards. Besides the technological aspects of NFC and the implementation of the payment system, this paper also presents the results of an eight month trial with 75 participants.},

Building on these results, a fair off-line electronic cash system (e-cash, for short) is presented featuring that all users are organised into a single group. This novel e-cash system is more efficient and more secure. It is able of coin tracing and owner tracing. The anonymity of the system can be revoked under certain conditions by an off-line trusted third authority. The system is untraceable (under normal cases), unlinkable, and resistant to double spending. Furthermore, compared with the previous e-cash systems, this payment protocol is computationally more efficient. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © Jarunee Wonglimpiyarat, 2016.},

This property reduces the size of the bank's database and the customer must spend the mobile cash before expiry. Moreover, the customer attaches the merchant's identity into the mobile cash in the deposit phase.

Various cryptographic protocols are utilized in modern e-commerce systems. Among them, it is possible to highlight the protocols of "withdrawal", "single coin payment" "whole wallet payment", "double-payment check for the same coin". Most of these protocols are built on the evidence of absolute non-disclosure of information. However, known protocols for "single coin payment" only allow a seller to determine presence of the electronic signature of the bank that issued an electronic wallet for a customer. The check of correct generation of an electronic coin serial number will allow a seller to determine an intruder prior to making a sell. Therefore, the development of a "single coin payment" protocol with checks for correct generation of an electronic note serial number which does not allow an intruder to pay using an electronic coin with a fake serial number is a signicant task.

Banks enjoyed an exclusive privilege to augment the money supply, maintaining deposit account balances that households and businesses could use as a means of payment and store of value. Banks were largely limited to conducting activities consistent with their monetary purpose. Geographic expansion was constrained to promote adequate service to local communities. And a government agency, the Federal Reserve, regulated the quantity of bank money in circulation and set the interest that accrued to its holders.

A substantial proportion of financial transactions are conducted using physical currency, QR codes provide a secure and traceable alternative for monitoring the movement of funds. Therefore, the purpose is to analyze factors influencing the use of QR payments and to assess the effectiveness of a dual-stage SEM-ANN approach in understanding these influences. This study employed a survey-based approach using a quantitative research design, with data collected from MSME owners in four major cities of Sindh. The survey, designed in English, Urdu, and Sindhi, was administered to 400 MSME owners. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analyses were conducted using SmartPLS-4 and SPSS-29. The findings reveal that Behavioral Intention (BI) to use QR codes is significantly influenced by Performance Expectancy (PE), Price Value (PV), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Habit, Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC), with PE and PV being the most impactful. Therefore, QR service providers (financial and non-financial institutes) are required to speed up the performance of their QR codes to increase the use of QR.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Although cash is the major form of payment system used in most developing countries, with the current trend in value of cheques processed through ECCS, it is a matter of time for cheques to become the dominant payment system. With the upward trend in the adoption and usage of ECCS in many countries, it is important to study the nature of the technology and understand factors that influence banks to accept the system. Previous research in e-banking adoption and acceptance has directed attention towards e-banking channels other than ECCS and level of analysis used is usually focused on the individual rather than the organisation. This study addresses these research gaps by exploring banks' acceptance factors among Ghanaian Banks. Using Technology Acceptance Model which is expanded with System Quality, Information Quality and Trust, the researchers undertook the study from the perspective of positivism, adopting a quantitative methodology to achieve the objectives. The research examined 25 commercial banks and 5 savings and loans companies which have different ways of adopting the technology. A survey instrument was used to gather data and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using Partial Least Squares (PLS) as the statistical model to analyse the data gathered. The findings supported all the hypothesis presented and showed that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are the major factors influencing banks' acceptance of the technology. Trust, IQ and SQ also affect banks' acceptance of ECCS positively but indirectly through PEOU and PU. The level of significance of PEOU was marginally lower compared to the level of significance for PU. The study therefore concurred with previous studies that in contexts where effective task execution substantially depends on the system such as the case with ECCS, beliefs about the system usefulness are more dominant in shaping acceptance than belief about ease of use. © Alexander Ekow Asmah, 2016.},

Upon the adaption of rational choice theory, this study comprehensively identifies the costs and benefits associated with debit card usage and tests the effects of these forces on debit cardholders' willingness to use the card. Moreover, this study also investigates the influence of cash habit on the willingness to use debit cards. This research employed both the qualitative method with in-depth interview to develop hypotheses and measurement scales and quantitative survey on 376 Vietnamese debit cardholders to test the conceptual model. The findings indicate that the willingness to use debit cards can be significantly encouraged by enhancing perceived benefits and reducing perceived adaptation costs associated with debit card usage. Moreover, although the habit of using cash does not directly affect willingness to use debit cards, it significantly weakens the positive impacts of perceived benefits and strengthens the negative impacts of perceived adaption costs on willingness to use debit cards. © 2020, Economic Research Institute of Chung-Ang University.},

This paper reviews the different initiatives strategized by the Indian government which led to the increased usage of UPI. The current research study focuses on awareness, acceptance, and usage of UPI among selected women in Pune region. The study includes descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and hypotheses testing. The data is analyzed using Python statistics libraries. Research shows that the majority of the women respondents have installed UPI on their own mobile but they still tend to prefer cash transactions over UPI in day-to-day life. Interestingly, women below the age of 40 prefer UPI transactions over cash. Occupation of a woman does not affect the preference for UPI or cash as a mode of transaction. The study also indicates that the age and occupation of women have an impact on the awareness about the knowledge of UPI and its configuration.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research aims to examine the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and its impact on behavior in the implementation of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in Indonesia. CBDC refers to a digital currency issued by the central bank that holds the same legal status as physical cash. The primary objective of CBDC as an alternative legal tender is to coexist harmoniously with physical currency, offering individuals the choice of CBDC as a legal tender for those who prefer digital currencies. Given the increasing reliance on technology in our daily lives, the acceptance of digital currency to facilitate transactions has become crucial for society. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing an individual's intention to adopt electronic money is of paramount importance. The research design employed in this study is quantitative with a descriptive approach. The research was conducted in Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The sample size was determined using Slovin's formula, with a 10% margin of error, resulting in a sample size of 99.9 samples. However, due to fractional subject numbers, it was rounded up to 100 samples. The data analysis technique used is multiple regression. To strengthen the research findings, the control variables gender, education, and age were used. The research findings indicate the following: (1) Attitude significantly and positively impacts the implementation of CBDC; (2) subjective norms have a significant negative impact on the implementation of CBDC; (3) perceived behavioral control (PBC) significantly impacts the implementation of CBDC; (4) the control variables gender, education, and age are correlated with the three TPB variables. © 2024 GMP Press and Printing.},

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), fiat-backed stablecoins (fsCOINs), and synthetic central bank digital currencies (sCBDCs) could offer improvements, but each comes with its own set of problems and conditions. Prior research reaches conflicting conclusions about the effect that each of these three financial assets has on systemic bank liquidity and fails to adequately address their net benefits relative to each other. This paper addresses these issues, including those connected to financial disintermediation, bank runs, outsourcing central bank activities, financial interoperability, cash equivalents, maturity transformation, required reserves, and changes in nations’ monetary bases. After addressing the strengths and weaknesses of fsCOINs and CBDCs, we conclude that sCBDCs provide the most significant net liquidity benefits when risks and returns are considered. © 2024 by the authors.},

Considering the significance of digital financial transactions in the present scenario of the COVID-19 crisis, this study has twin objectives: firstly, to examine the use of digital financial transactions in COVID-19 and secondly, to explore the existence of any relationship between financial literacy and the use of digital financial transactions, especially by low-income groups in India. This study uses secondary data from authorised and government sources for the analysis of the research objectives. Logistic regression model was deployed on National Centre for Financial Education (NCFE) (2019) survey data of around 36,600 low-income group to interpret the relationship between financial literacy and digital financial transactions. The analysis of the data suggested that financial literacy was significant in positively affecting digital financial transactions. In this regard, financial literacy could play an instrumental role, which is also being indicated through our estimated results. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In the meantime, customers in the modern society expect more convenient methods to make financial transaction with enhanced security measures. This paper describes how a QR based payment system which can be controlled by voice commands simplifies business operations between customer and vendor. QR code based mobile payments represent a relatively new technology that can be used in the new business arena of payments using smartphones. It provides a flexible and cashless environment for users. It is more secure and easier to; pay in supermarkets, shopping malls, as well as the user can share money with their friends and families, even can be manipulated by voice commands. The use of such devices in the payment process has lots of advantages in terms of speed and comfort when accessing services, and also improves the security and integrity of transactions, and the simplicity with user friendly interactions. To evaluate the potential of QR code-based voice support payment system, in the context of business transactions, VoiceNote updates monetary transaction in real-time and uses encryption and decryption methods for security. The transaction details can be analyzed and forecast through a web dashboard. VoiceNote research findings shows that transaction time is reduced by an average of 64 seconds when compared with a cash transaction and an average reduction of 13.5 seconds when compared with card transactions. © 2019 University of Kelaniya.},

	abstract = {In only a few ten years payment systems have undergone an incredible evolution passing from a physical transfer of cash to transactions exchanging money as digital data. Mobile Payment (m-payment) refers to one type of electronic payment, performed through mobile devices, such as mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets. To ensure trust and avoid frauds severe security requirements must be imposed. In addition, interoperability and privacy requirements, as well as speed of execution and ease-of-use are mandatory requirements, too. Several technical solutions have been proposed, associated to generally incompatible business models. From the end-users point of view, the result of a m-payment transaction is just one transfer of money from customer to merchant. However, to get this simple result, m-payments use a plethora of sophisticated technologies, including SMS, NFC, high-frequency sound waves, software apps. The heterogeneity of m-payment systems and economic models is an important challenge for their diffusion in the next years. Having described the main requirements, technical characteristics and different business models of m-payment, this paper underlines relationship of technological and business approach to m-payment systems. © 2014 AEIT.},

	abstract = {In the recent years payment systems in Europe are evolved to a new scenario where transactions and retail payments take place according to the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) Regulation. SEPA is an initiative of the European banking industry aiming at making all electronic payments across the Euro area-e.g. by credit card, debit card, bank transfer or direct debit-As easy as domestic payments currently are. One of the payment schemes defined by the SEPA mandate is the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) that allows a creditor (biller) to collect funds from a debtor's (payer's) account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller. Thanks to SDD consumers can make and receive no-cash euro payments with a single set of instructions and a single bank account. It is apparent that the use of this standard scheme facilitates the access to new markets by enterprises and public administrations and allows for a substantial cost reduction. However, the other side of the coin is represented by the security issues concerning this type of electronic payments. A study conducted by Center of Economics and Business Research (CEBR) of Britain, on behalf of Liverpool Insurance Company, showed that from 2006 to 2010 the Direct Debit frauds have increased of 288%. In this paper a comprehensive analysis of real SDD data provided by the EU FP7 LeanBigData project is performed in order to identify and classify emerging and sophisticated attack patterns that can be executed against an SDD service. The results of this data analysis will be used to inspire the design of a security system supporting analysts to detect Direct Debit frauds. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The article deals with the main problems of criminal characteristics of electronic money and payments as instruments of crime. The article reveals the economic and legal nature of electronic money (e-money). The features of e-money and its relation to electronic payments are identified. It is proved that intensive development of the IT sector results in an increasing replacement of cash by cashless methods of payment, and e-money is required for making payments online. E-money is previously created in all cases where they are stored on an electronic device and are used as means of payment, therefore they significantly reduce the level of abuse against property. Criminals in the real estate leasing sector use it as a tool when they commit cybercrime - a new place that has been transformed into a powerful source using for crime. Particular attention in this article is paid to the criminal characteristics of electronic money as an instrument of crime. Electronic money has been updated to account for a significant number of offending characters, while these crimes operate in free currency from a non-supported market and move to electronic services, they are used, and may be joined by warehouse resources, which require a criminal law level. It also indicates that e-money is being received by its billing service, and then can be exploited by attackers to trick owners who have already participated in their work. Through this process, using e-money and electronic payment is almost legal and covers the concept of legality. It is disclosed that the main complexity in detecting malicious tools creates electronic money, which makes it difficult to track the traces of such crime, which uses its delays in cyber space. The author also reveals an accurate view of electronic money resources, such as what is more likely to be abused, which is an additional element of criminal execution qualification. © 2020 Vozniuk et.al..

	abstract = {The current payment system is rapid but has limits in terms of internet consumption, visibility, and usability. It is based on physical cash and online transactions. Central bank digital currencies strive to tackle the difficulties that afflict the current economic system by providing total transparency of the money supply. As opposed to completely decentralized cryptocurrencies, central bank-issued digital currencies are the most centralized. However, centralization will be advantageous in terms of money programmability, improved transparency, and financial crime monitoring. Before digital currencies can be widely used, a strong security framework, data protection, and effective governance will be required. Major central banks around the world are exploring technologies and methodologies to deploy their own version of digital currency that can coexist with the current physical cash and in near future replace the traditional form of value transfer. It can be promising for enhancing the economic outreach of a country and releasing a broad range of possibilities when it comes to financial inclusion and ease of transactions. CBDCs will not only help in easing payments but will help in government fund disbursements directly to eligible individuals without the interference of an intermediary bank, frictionless and faster value transfer, and exploring new financial mechanisms. These systems to support the CBDC architecture will require a robust security system that can be used for secure payments but the system design should also be simple and flexible enough to accommodate future design changes. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.

This is for the majority of users - in general - not acceptable. Such an approach fails to replace the role of cash in e-commerce systems. The basic result of this research is a new prepaid multi-hop (transferable) cash payment system solution based on hardware technology implementing an electronic wallet (e-wallet) to accommodate digital coins. Transparent cash transfer (exchange) protocol software can serve at any network device as Internet host, mobile device or any future general purpose communication link. The result is a peer to peer (P2P) electronic cash transfer equivalent to a physical cash transfer in public use. This e-cash system could be a possible alternative to the physical coins & bills. It is a multi-purpose inter-operable digital cash payment scheme for domestic usage. The system is suitable for low value (micro payments in the 1 cent range), as well as for larger payments, regardless of the communication platform or transmission medium.},

	abstract = {For real-world applications digital coin systems, i.e., off-line payment systems offering not only the unforgeability of conventional coins but also the anonymity of customers making purchases, need to have some additional features. One of these additional features is the hardware protection of the system, provided by dedicated tamper-resistant devices called observers which are used to physically prevent illegitimate copying of coins. Another essential feature for practical applications is anonymity-revocation mechanisms. Basically, digital coin systems guarantee perfect anonymity, i.e., the bank cannot link views of the withdrawal and payments in order to determine whether or not a customer spent her money at a certain shop. The customer’s privacy protection is the main difference between coin systems and those based on credit card or cheque based systems. While privacy protection is a desirable property of cash systems, perfect anonymity is not. Perfect anonymity makes possible perfect blackmailing or money laundering. To prevent such “perfect crime” it must be possible to revoke the anonymity of customers in case of need. Anonymity revocation is done by a trusted third party. Cash systems that allow anonymity revocation are called fair. We present a coin system featuring both observer and fairness, showing that both concepts do not interfere with each other and can be implemented simultaneously without loss of security. We prove this claim not only by presenting a fair variant of the Brands’ coin system but additionally by outlining a generic framework for fair wallets in which essentially any blind signature scheme can be used. Unlike other fair off-line coin systems, fairness is implemented with the help of the observer, thereby reducing the computational effort during the withdrawal. © 2006, MDPI. All rights reserved.},

This type of payment method is based on the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and has already provided to the cards from the world's largest companies in financial services and payment systems, such as Visa and MasterCard in the last years. Additionally, the differences between adopters and non-adopters of contactless cards are investigated by the utilization of the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. The characteristics and preferences of the individuals who utilize them for their purchases are also examined. The results show that Greeks greatly use NFC cards, especially the debit ones, to purchase various types of products and services. Females seem more acceptable to them than males. Furthermore, as it was expected, adopters do perceive the advantages that this payment method can offer them to a much greater extent than non-adopters. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).},

The traditional banking industry is facing challenges brought by new technologies. The main purpose of this study is to investigate customer trust and loyalty transferring from physical banks to mobile payments because mobile payment platforms are a self-service technology. The goal is to create an eco-platform to facilitate transition from a cash-based economy to a cashless economy. This study is the first attempt to integrate platform management, electronic marketing (online trust and online loyalty), and relationship marketing (offline trust and offline loyalty) into one model. We theoretically and empirically take certain factors into consideration to further explore the transfer impact of physical to mobile payments, which is not discussed in literature. The SEM (structural equation modelling) analysis from the 353 respondents in this study found that trust from both the physical and mobile contexts has positively influenced loyalty. Additionally, customers’ trust and loyalty transfer from the physical to the mobile environment has had a significantly positive effect between the physical and mobile environment. Corporate reputation and structure assurance have also significantly positively affected physical trust and mobile trust, respectively. The findings also reveal that the structure assurance plays an essential role in mobile payment. Users may have certain concerns about the procedure of transactions and their personal information. Theoretical and practical implications are provided. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

One of its Arabica coffee production areas is located at Andungsari village, where coffee agribusinesses are managed by smallholder farmers, members of the Andung Tani I farmer group. This research aims to seek to identify the Arabica coffee supply chain management, the added value of processing products from the Arabica coffee agroindustry and the quality management in the supply chain. The agribusiness supply chains, value creation and quality management are important to be investigated since they are managed inclusively by a smallholder farmer group. The research method is descriptive analysis to explain supply chain and integrated quality management and Hayami method analysis for the added value of Arabica coffee. The results of the analysis show that (1) Based on the supply chain conditions including five aspects regarding the local-international target market, marketing institutions, contract and trust systems, as well as cash and transfer payment systems, the Andung Tani I Farmer Group supply chain has fulfilled aspects that can be used in tackling market conditions and meet consumer demand; (2) All Arabica coffee products of Andung Tani I agroindustry show positive and fairly high added value ratio. Among the three products, ground coffee has the highest added value, far greater than the added value of the coffee green beans (HS and Ose). These results confirm that further processing and advanced technology increases the added value earned by the firm; and (3) The smallholders' Arabica coffee supply chain in Bondowoso has fairly implemented integrated quality management consisting of 10 aspects of the national quality standard SNI 01-3542- 2004 in response to the market. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Riding on the back of the growth of e-commerce (electronic commerce), India is witnessing exponential growth in the area of digital payments in recent times. The increased incidence of online banking and e-commerce has led to the emergence of the E-wallet. The E-wallet is a virtual money wallet which facilitates online payments instantly and enables users to make payments for utility bills, book tickets, transfer money and make instant e-payments while shopping, in physical stores or e-stores. In general, as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), there are three kinds of E-wallets - closed, semi-closed and open that are issued by banks. A closed wallet is one that a company issues to its consumers for its in-house goods and services. A semi-closed wallet can be used for goods and services, including financial services, at select merchant locations or establishments that have a contract with the issuing company to accept these payment instruments. Closed and Semi-closed wallets do not permit cash withdrawal or redemption by the holder. Open wallets are used for the purchase of goods and services, including financial services such as funds transfer at merchant locations or point of sale terminals that accept cards, and they also allow cash withdrawals at automated teller machines (ATMs). Apart from independent wallets, mobile operators and banks have rolled out similar services. The reason for choosing E-wallets for our research study was due to the popularity it has gained in India in the recent times. Secondly, to see the challenges that E-wallets will face against the banks in India due to the emergence of Unified Payment Interface (UPI). The research conducted was primarily through questionnaires. For analyzing and studying customer saving behaviour and earnings of E-wallet companies, secondary data was collected through internet articles, researches and journals. Background/Objectives: To study the rise and acceptance of E-wallets by Indian consumers and to analyze E-wallet companies after the introduction of Unified Payment Interface by the Reserve Bank of India. Methods/ Statistical analysis: The research was designed using quantitative technique in the form of a questionnaire which was sent to respondents to get an insight on usage of E-wallets. A pilot study was administered to 10 respondents and the results were used to analyze, modify and prepare the final draft of the questionnaire. In order to test hypotheses, the statistical tool - Karl Pearson's co-efficient of correlation was used. Findings: This research has clearly indicated that although respondents are quite knowledgeable about E-wallets, their usage is very limited due to safety concerns. The research has also lent evidence to the fact that there will be huge scope and opportunities for digital payment players to increase their market size. It was learnt that the introduction of UPI mobile app will overcome challenges that banks are currently facing as it can drive large scale adoption of digital payments. From the primary research it was observed that the awareness of UPI is quite negligible in comparison to E-wallets amongst the users. This will have a positive impact and will encourage E-wallet companies, banks as well as other payment service providers to launch more initiatives which might increase private consumption. Our findings indicate that E-wallets in the future will be able to solve some of the existing problems, and face new challenges from banks. Conclusion/Improvements: Benefits offered to users will be key to keep a strong hold on the customer base. Opportunities for digital payments are nascent yet quite sizeable with positive trends over the years.},

In addition, payment transactions need to be made less expensive and more user-friendly than those offered by private intermediaries. The paper explains the benefits of adopting a digital currency instead of relying on cash alone, such as the ability to send and receive payments remotely, improved security, and greater transparency vis-à-vis historical transactions. After discussing the key design features that a digital euro might adopt, the paper concludes that an account-based digital euro could have a greater impact on financial inclusion than a token-based euro.The more that digital euro accounts are integrated into existing payment systems, the greater the benefits will be. © Henry Stewart Publications,.},

Resources permitting, over 50 thousand domestic customers would have had their supply disconnected. Clearly, the business could not continue with such high levels of debts and disconnections. Domestic sales are now reported to amount to £375 million. Despite the huge increase, and an even greater rise in Commercial and Industrial sales, bad debts in simple pound terms are now virtually the same level as in 1978.

	abstract = {Mobile payments have been evolving over a decade and proliferation is largely for contact less wallet services. Most such services are closed loop payment services provided by specific service providers. These services have the advantage of instant settlements for their subscribers. However, a few such providers in the market could again lead to the classic Master-Visa market dominance. This paper proposes interoperability between wallet providers. Such wallet services serve a niche need for retail payments and specifically low value payments. The intention of providing interoperability between such providers is to fulfill the need for instant settlements for low value payments. This could potentially target cash payments which require instant settlements. In this paper, the scenarios are illustrated, a service architecture is defined and a service description is proposed. © 2014 IEEE.},

In office hour with limited break time either breakfast or lunch everyone is rushing to get food and crowded situation are happen. One of the issues is payment system use manually (cash) and queue at the cashier to pay foods, sometime need to wait a few minute until to get the turn. Cashless payment such as token or credit system is implementing in some of restaurant and food courts but does not applicable in University canteen that most of customers are students with small transaction, only a few dollars and cents. Nowadays, mobile phone or smart phone is not a luxury thing and most of student carries it for phone call, message, email, or browsing internet. Most of smart phone also embedded with Near Field Communication (NFC) reader inside the phone, thus by using this phone with NFC enable to do payment system at the canteen. The credit is deducted from mobile phone balance for pre-paid system or billed in monthly for postpaid and this system have working together to the cellular phone operator. Confirmation on payment system is shows whether customer approve payment or not then a notification is sent to user.With this system be able to overcome several issues such as queue at cashier for payment and risk of student to carry cash money while buying foods. © 2015, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The legal basis for resolving the issues of combating fraud in the field of electronic banking with regard to international standards, namely the experience of the European Union, was studied. The objectives of an effective fight against fraud in the banking sector were disclosed, taking into account the provisions of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council On combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA, 2017. Attention was paid to the settlement of issues of combating fraud in the field of banking services in Ukraine, in particular, attention was focused on the activities of the EMA Association, as the national representative of Ukraine in EAST - European Association for Secure Transactions. The problematic aspects of the return of funds lost by a client of the bank from fraud on the part of third parties were identified. © 2019 Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.},

This redistribution is the largest when only financial market participants have a choice between multiple means of payments while non-participants do not. Welfare analysis reveals that the effectiveness of monetary policy on the economy is the greatest when all agents (financial market participants and nonparticipants) can choose from alternative means of payment in a financially segmented model.

	abstract = {The international literature on M&As is extensive, but surprisingly little evidence exists for the Nordic countries. This article attempts to fill the gap by studying 184 merger announcements from 1995 to 2014. Our findings differ in a number of ways. “First, we extend the current literature since we find that diversifying acquisitions” generate a higher bidder abnormal return compared with focused transactions. A possible explanation is that in diversifying acquisitions acquirers overpay for target firms within their core industry because they overestimate operational synergies. The managerial implication is that the notion of core business should not restrict diversified value-enhancing M&As. Secondly, we find evidence that bidder abnormal returns depend not on the method of payment. The implication is that bidders may have more flexibility with regard to the financing of deals in the Nordic countries, because the acquirer’s managers do not have to take into account any negative market reactions with regard to the payment method. Thirdly, we explore the relationship between cash flows and abnormal returns. Our results confirm current literature since we find that low-valued bidders with excessive free cash flows experience negative returns prior to an announcement. Furthermore, our results imply that a bidder company must be able convincingly to justify an acquisition to the market by communicating the presence of a sound and coherent integration plan. © 2017, International Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

	abstract = {The introduction of interest-bearing Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) presents central banks with an additional instrument for implementing monetary policy. This article develops a Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian model, incorporating financial frictions, to investigate the transmission mechanism and wealth distribution effects of digital currency interest rate from two distinct perspectives: (i) the interaction between the central bank and financial intermediaries and (ii) the substitution dynamics between cash and digital currency. By comparing models that include and exclude financial intermediaries, our research uncovers that in a society where CBDC is fully implemented, the reverse actions of financial intermediaries can hinder the efficacy of the central bank’s monetary policy and result in elevated costs associated with policy formulation. Additionally, the leverage effect of financial intermediaries exacerbates wealth inequality and contributes to the expansion of investment, thereby promoting an increase in economic output. Comparing societies where CBDC entirely replaces cash with those where CBDC coexists alongside cash, this paper demonstrates that the presence of cash mitigates significant economic fluctuations triggered by CBDC, while the complete elimination of cash amplifies wealth inequality. Consequently, it is crucial for the central bank to account for the behavior of financial intermediaries when adjusting digital currency interest rate and explore the development of an appropriate interest rate mechanism tailored to digital currency. Simultaneously, maintaining cash circulation for a specific period can act as an economic stabilizer. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISEG – Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão 2024.},

Methodology: This study used a questionnaire for data collection among 250 retailers in Uttarakhand, India. The questionnaire was later on analyzed using SPSS. Qualitative data was gathered from the interview with the officials from 100 financial intermediaries from banks. Findings: The Indian retail market has been fostered by the cash dealings. The step of demonetization caught the black marketers, retailers and common people by surprise. The move was supported by the majority of people despite facing difficulties. After the demonetization, people started using the adoption of different forms of digital payment options. The trade in the market was affected and the retail sales witnessed a severe dip. The market is recovering but the actual recovery will depend on devising the substitute for the cash payments at all levels of retailers. Social implications: Financial inclusion is important for inclusive growth and bank to have a crucial role to play in financial literacy campaigns and should ensure that those deprived sections that come to exchange their old notes are properly taken care of. Banks could make unbanked people aware about the financial instruments available with banks and the importance of saving and putting their money in these instruments. This step would further help the economy move from unorganized to organized sector. The originality of Study: This study is original and first of its kind conducted in Uttarakhand, India. © Kandpal et al.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify the challenges that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru has faced with the issuance of a digital currency that can be used as a substitute for cash in retail transactions. The study was carried out by using the hypothetical-deductive method with a basic descriptive approach rather than an experimental one. To estimate the probability of creating the Digital Currency of the Central Bank and the economic variables that explain its challenges and cross-sectional information obtained from the 2020 National Household Survey with the discrete choice model (Logit). According to the research results, i) the possibility of using a digital currency increases by 46.83% if you have a formal job compared to an informal job. ii) If the individual has an internet connection, the probability of using digital currency is 8.54%. iii) If he lives in a rural area, the probability of using digital currency is 1.79. iv) The educational level influences the probability of the use of digital currency by 1.47% if they have secondary education 16.34% have no higher education and 26.44% having university education. v) Individual’s age is important for the use of a digital currency. Older people are less likely to adapt to technology than people between the age of 18 and 24 with 8.74% use of digital currency. vi) People considered poor will have a probability of reduction of 2.26% by the use of digital currency. These findings allow the researcher to conclude that public policies should be undertaken to increase financial inclusion, close connectivity gaps and create alliances with private investment to enhance people's digital skills and the adoption of digital means of payment. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Online Academic Press, USA.},

	abstract = {In the current highly competitive landscape, leading organizations find it increasingly challenging to maintain a competitive edge against global rivals in a world characterized by increasing interconnectedness. Electronic payments, encompassing a spectrum of financial transactions conducted devoid of traditional paper-based documents, have gained prominence. These transactions include the use of debit cards, credit cards, smart cards, e-wallets, e-cash, electronic cheques, and more. However, the acceptance and utilization of e-payment systems exhibit substantial variations across the globe, with some methods enjoying widespread adoption while others languish with lower utilization rates. This study is designed with the objective of meticulously identifying the multifaceted issues and challenges that confront electronic payment systems. Additionally, we will present potential solutions to enhance the digital payment system. It’s important to note that while digital payment systems offer numerous opportunities, they also bring along lots of potential threats and challenges. The Rajkot District is the focus of the study, with 104 participants. Convenience-based sampling was used to choose the participants. Interview schedules and a Google form were used to collect primary data. The data was analyzed and interpreted using simple percentage analysis and the Likert scale. The study’s findings highlight the region’s persistent reliance on cash transactions. As a result, there is a clear need for increased customer awareness programs targeted at teaching customers about the convenience and benefits of digital payment channels as a replacement for cash transactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

We assume that the user does not trust the delegated person nor the merchant and wishes to minimize the information transmitted to the user's bank. Our system protects the user from fraud perpetrated by the delegated party or by the merchant. The scheme has a number of other applications such as delegating the withdrawal of cash from Automated Teller Machines ATM and allowing companies to restrict an employee's expenses during business trips. Merx is designed to be used with mobile phones and mobile computing devices, especially in situations where end-users do not have access to the Internet. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism and show that it requires negligible overhead and can be gradually deployed as it is able to piggyback on existing payment-network infrastructures. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, more than one year after its launch, its usage is yet to gain a critical mass.

First, its status as legal tender is questionable; secondly, it undermines privacy, a critical component of physical cash. Thirdly, it is incapable of wide acceptance by individuals and entities across Nigeria.

Nevertheless, cash is still predominant. This raises questions about the factors that can promote the usage of digital payments by consumers. Purpose of the paper. This paper aims at investigating the factors affecting the adoption of digital payments by Italian consumers, extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology in a consumer context (UTAUT2) with three constructs that are relevant when analyzing this topic, namely the role of government incentives, the concerns related to privacy, and the degree of aversion towards tax evasion. Methodology. To empirically assess the proposed research model, we gathered data in Italy through a web-based survey and analyzed them using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling. Results. Findings confirm the UTAUT2 model, except for price value, which is found to be insignificant. Government incentives and tax evasion aversion have a significant positive impact on the behavioral intention to adopt digital payments, whereas privacy concerns have a significant negative effect. Research limitations. The main limitation of this study concerns data gathering, as it was conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing methodology, which targets consumers that are already familiar with digital instruments. Practical implications. The paper highlights the factors that both digital payment providers and public institutions may leverage to foster the adoption of digital payments by consumers. Originality of the paper. To the best of our knowledge, this study is unique as it examines the adoption of digital payments by Italian consumers, extending the framework to prepaid, credit, and debit cards, instead of considering mobile payments alone. © 2024 Fondazione Cueim.

However, continuity remains a challenge for users in these regions favoring cash. To address this, we investigate how users often exhibit herding behavior that influences mobile payment usage and not just techno-behavioral factors, as suggested by past literature. We propose that users frequently imitate others’ actions owing to the networked nature of mobile payment technology and design a research model comprising multiple dimensions of both rational and irrational herding behavior affecting its continued usage. With 507 user survey responses, we confirmed our model’s validity. Results reveal a balancing impact of both rational and irrational herding on continuance intention, providing insights for enhancing the technology’s popularity in financial inclusion efforts.

	abstract = {Mobile payment has been predicted to become the “new normal” in the payments industry. However, such predictions have hardly been realized in the Euro area, since most payments at the point of sale (POS) are still conducted in cash. Mobile payment represents a specific case of multi-sided markets, where the functioning of the whole market relies on the interaction between several players – in this case at least two, i.e. merchants and consumers – on a common platform. As such, every innovation that is brought to this market has to be adopted by both sides in order to be widely diffused. For the successful dissemination of mobile payment, however, it is important that merchants are among the early adopters, as merchants are the ones who directly cover the costs of the system. Nevertheless, despite its importance, extant research on mobile payment has often neglected the role of merchants. Our research in progress is set to investigate the main features of competition that will eventually stimulate merchants’ adoption of mobile payment at the POS. Empirical evidence will be provided via a survey targeting merchants with at least one physical POS. The results are expected to contribute to the literature on mobile payment, as well as that on the diffusion of innovations and multi-sided markets. © 2018 University of Maribor Press.},

	abstract = {The most common consumer behavior was to pay in cash at a physical store in the past. However, with the rapid development and popularization of smart handheld devices and computers, merchants have had many innovative business models in recent years. For example, the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has the advantages of decentralization, anonymity, and the inability to tamper with data. If these benefits are combined with the current electronic payment financial operation model, they will be highly innovative. However, blockchain technologies have been applied to decentralized network architectures. As a result, the financial system will face anonymous crime, extensive data synchronization, and time-consuming transaction processes. This paper implements a P2P electronic payment system with a hierarchical structure based on the blockchain architecture, called CBP2P (Cooperative Bank Peer-to-Peer), to improve the defects and realize an accurate electronic payment system.

One of the e-commerce platforms that is aggressive in promoting and widely used by Indonesian consumers is Shopee. Shopee conducts promotions in Indonesia to bring new shopping experiences to facilitate easy sales and provide shoppers with secure payment processes and integrated logistics arrangements.The research purpose is to determine reputation’s effect, privacy, size, safeguard, web familiarity, and ease in creating a positive effect on confidence; and trust variable will have a positive effect on payment methods using the electronic payment system (EPS), credit cards and cash on delivery on product purchases at online shops in Indonesia. The research methodology uses quantitative methods with a cross-sectional research design by distributing questionnaires online with a Google Form, with 248 respondents. The study led to the findings of the perceptions of trust significantly influenced by security, benefits, and convenience, while reputation, privacy, size, and web familiarization do not affect trust. Furthermore, trust affects the electronic payment method (EPS), credit card, and cash on delivery. The limitation of the study is in the sampling method which covers not all regions in Indonesia. Contribution: as a company, Shopee should maintain security, the benefits, and convenience to develop strategies using electronic payment methods. © 2022, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The dawn of the digital era has opened an unprecedented opportunity for the agribusiness sector to access collateral-free loans from fintech companies based on the track record of their digital payments. However, to capitalize on this opportunity, the agribusiness sector needs to digitalize their operations and make all its business transactions digital.

Within the Rubin causal model, we investigate the causal effects of the use of debit cards on the cash inventories held by households by using data from the Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth. We adopt the principal stratification approach to incorporate the share of debit card holders who do not use this payment instrument. We use a regression model with the propensity score as the single predictor to adjust for the imbalance in observed covariates. We further develop a sensitivity analysis approach to assess the sensitivity of the proposed model to violation of the key unconfoundedness assumption.

This study looks at the challenges that instant payment systems may face in developing economies like Colombia as they advance further into the person-to-business (P2B) transaction space. Using a survey of Colombian merchants, the study explores the factors associated with mer-chants’ propensity to adopt instant payments and identifies those associated with the adoption of electronic payment alternatives. The study finds that instant payment systems will require a broad strategy if they are to penetrate the P2B space, as they will have to compete with the low marginal costs and immediacy offered by cash and the high levels of informality in the commerce sector, espe-cially for micro businesses. Furthermore, instant payment systems will have to meet merchants’ high expectations with respect to enabling access to other financial services, enhancing competitiveness and increasing their bottom line. © 2021, Henry Stewart Publications.

The results underline the relevance of the short-term interest rate, the payments infrastructure, and the financial transaction tax on the preferences for payment instruments of this population. Particularly, it is observed that the rise in the number of point-of-sale devices has started to represent a threat to the prevalence of cash, but that idiosyncratic factors such as insecurity and informality incentivise its usage. © 2018 Universidad de Antioquia.

We have done a frame work on vending sub-urban train ticket's using mobile application which makes use of instant payment method. Generally in sub-urban stations we do not have enough number of counters for getting our tickets quickly. So this application tries to eradicate the drawbacks of existing IRCTC's application and incorporates an innovative idea of payment via mobile balance and Cash card. And the implementation of this application will have a great impact during peak working hours of our day to day life. And we hope that enormous number of people those who travel by train's everyday will get benefitted by this application. This could also be incorporated in upcoming Metro train project. Similar situations apply for many services, where payment will be delayed due to large number of users waiting. So this approach addresses these situations. Instant payment for services has its own challenges and the paper describes the approaches taken. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increasing amount of data being generated, marketers and marketing researchers face the challenge of effectively analyzing and interpreting insights from the data. The volume of data poses challenges for humans; however, using automated content analysis techniques frees the researcher to focus on the distilled data. Even though multiple forms of text analysis techniques have been discussed in prior marketing literature, few articles simplify the techniques enough to allow for easy adoption by readers. This article discusses three text analysis techniques and then applies these techniques to a dataset of 1287 newspaper articles following the major demonetization announcement in India. It provides an interesting insight into the life of the Indian citizen faced with a government-mandated drive that demonetized 86% of the currency, endangering everyday retail transactions in a cash-dominated economy. Interesting insights emerging from simple techniques such as comparative word frequencies and sentiment analysis are presented which highlight the coping techniques used by the people to continue retail transactions. The initial desperation led to attempts to use the demonetized currency notes by splurging on gold, liquor, and fuel. Once the awareness about the absence of valid currency seeped in, people focused on more thought-out attempts to sustain normal retail transactions. Further, topic modeling was applied to discover the underlying topics in the data corpus, which further revealed the repertoire of coping strategies used by the people. A topic that stood out in the analysis was related to retail-focused mobile payment services, which subsequently found large-scale acceptance in the economy. The article drives home the point that while automated content analysis may provide a quick and simplified view of the data, the role of the researcher in qualitatively interpreting the data is not trivial. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Bangladesh has witnessed a transformative shift towards digitization as a key driver for enhancing citizen security and fostering economic prosperity. This abstract explores the multifaceted impact of digitization on the socio-economic landscape of Bangladesh and how it contributes to safeguarding citizen security while catalyzing economic growth. The study used first-hand information. Face-to-face interviews with members of the general public at different levels were used to gather primary data on the ground. In order to identify the driving forces behind citizen security, the gathered data were edited, coded, and evaluated. Descriptive statistical methods and tools were used in the study to conduct the analysis on the data sets and generate the results. According to an analysis of the survey's field level data, 92 percent of respondents believe that security is important for creating a digital Bangladesh that protects its citizens. The majority of locals (85%) are unaware of digital security. 85% of residents are unaware about digital security. The majority of rural communities lack adequate knowledge of digital schooling. The building of a digital Bangladesh will be extremely simple and the protection of all deserving residents of the nation will be guaranteed if the development of digital education is feasible. The digitization initiatives in Bangladesh encompass various sectors, including governance, finance, healthcare, and education. The implementation of digital governance has streamlined administrative processes, reducing bureaucratic bottlenecks and enhancing the efficiency of public services. This not only ensures a more transparent and accountable government but also strengthens the security of citizens' personal data. The financial sector has witnessed a paradigm shift with the widespread adoption of digital payment systems and mobile banking. This has not only provided financial inclusion to previously underserved populations but has also mitigated the risks associated with traditional cash transactions. The increased accessibility to financial services has empowered citizens and contributed to economic prosperity by fostering entrepreneurship and facilitating smoother business transactions. Furthermore, the digitization of healthcare services has improved accessibility and quality of medical care, especially in remote areas. Telemedicine and digital health records have played a pivotal role in connecting patients with healthcare professionals, ensuring timely and efficient healthcare delivery. This has not only safeguarded the health of citizens but has also contributed to overall economic productivity by reducing absenteeism due to health-related issues. In conclusion, the ongoing digitization initiatives in Bangladesh have emerged as a powerful catalyst for safeguarding citizen security and fostering economic prosperity. As the nation continues to embrace digital transformation, a strategic and inclusive approach is crucial to harness the full potential of digitization and create a resilient, secure, and prosperous future for its citizens. © 2024 AESSRA.

	abstract = {Few studies distinguish between the method of payment and the means of financing in mergers and acquisitions. This paper aims to test if the financing means has incremental information beyond that contained in the payment means. To answer this question, we consider a sample of 265 deals undertaken by French listed acquires between January 1997 and December 2008. We decompose our sample according to the method of payment (cash, stock or mixed payment). The difference of means test shows that the impact of the three methods of payment is not statistically significant. In order to take the analysis further, we then broke our sample down according to both the method of payment and the means of financing (debt, equity or internal funds). The difference of means test, the event study methodology and OLS regressions reveal that takeovers financed by debt outperform those financed by other means of financing. These findings confirm the monitoring role of debt and support the pecking order preferences. Finally, our OLS regressions highlight that market reaction depends also on legal environment (common law vs. non common law) on acquisition characteristics such as deal size and on acquirer specific factors such as size and growth opportunities. © by author(s); CC-BY.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid advancement of digital technology has transformed the landscape of financial transactions, with e-wallets emerging as a popular method of payment among various demographics. Among these, the youth population in Malaysia has demonstrated a significant inclination towards adopting e-wallets due to their convenience and efficiency. Understanding the factors that influence the use intention of e-wallets among Malaysian youth is essential for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers to promote and enhance digital payment adoption. Consumers are adopting digital payment using financial technology as a result of the development of e-wallet systems. A mobile device's e-wallet application enables users to download payment cards. The use of e-wallet apps as a substitute for traditional payment methods has recently become more popular among users. An E-wallet user doesn't have to carry cash or a credit card with them at all times. A more convenient way of purchasing is possible using this e-wallet. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of E-wallet adoption among Malaysian youth is examined in this research along with the factors that influence them to use an e-wallet. This TAM serves as underpinning for the research framework. The SmartPLS-SEM approach is used to analyze the proposed research framework. The technology acceptance model consists of “perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived security have positive and significant relationships with behavioral intention to use an e-wallet”. This outcome contributes to a deeper understanding of the value of utilizing an e-wallet for transactional reasons by the government and service providers in the digital market. © 2024 UCJC BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW.

So far, the security and privacy aspects of iButtons have been widely unexplored. The so-called Secure iButtons are advocated for security critical applications for e.g., micropayment, authentication or feature activation. In this paper we present for the first time a detailed security analysis of the Secure iButtons DS1963S. Although no technical details are publicly available, Secure iButtons have a variety of physical and cryptographic built-in measures to protect against physical tampering as well as unauthorized access to cryptographic material. We developed methods to bypass all these protection mechanisms of the manufacturer. We present a differential fault attack and implementation attack on the SHA-1-enabled iButton (DS1963S chip). Beside the emulation and impersonation, our attacks succeed in extracting the secret keys stored in the iButton. Our methods allow an infinite rollback to the initial state, which is crucial when targeting micropayment systems based on iButtons. We also demonstrate our attacks on Maxims reference platform of a micropayment system. Our best attack requires a minimal financial invest and take less than ten minutes, including target preparation, while the pure attack on all eight 64-bit keys is completed in a few seconds. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

As a result of the ongoing processes of digitization of social relations, a specific means of payment that is electronic money, the nature of which remained unresolved by the legislator, appeared in the current legislation. An analysis of existing approaches has led to the conclusion that the doctrine usually qualifies electronic money as a type of obligation, money law, a requirement expressed in electronic form. They are independent objects of civil rights that do not coincide with non-cash money and with “digital money” (cryptocurrency). Furthermore, the article concluded that, besides the change in the existing approaches to the objects of civil legal relations, the Internet environment has led to the transformation of the existing ideas about their subjects, as a result of which the accepted definition of this civil law category becomes ineffective. It is argued that the Internet space contains subjects with some specific features, such as unlimited composition; a high degree of anonymity; extraterritoriality of action; self-management and self-organization. These features do not allow the effective use of civil law to resolve conflicts. The arising difficulties have been studied using the example of the participation of public legal entities and their officials in the Internet. © Siberian Federal University. All rights reserved.},

With the advent of QRIS mobile payments, transactions in many areas of the business scene, especially in stores, have been disrupted. From cash and EDC (Electronic Data Capture) payments, it has become common in Indonesia to use QR payments with QRIS. A comprehensive review of the scientific literature shows the development of a behavioral model that explains the preference for using QRIS. This study uses a sample of 17-30 years old classified as active mobile payment users who regularly use QRIS in their business. This research aims to seek relationships between two variables by analyzing a quantitative type with a conclusive and descriptive research design. This study uses the technology acceptance model (TAM) to form different behaviors depending on the user's usage of each payment method offered. Insights and impacts on management provide an alternative to operating a business. This research uses SmartPLS since the focus of the research is to analyze the relationship between constructs, not analyzing a model. Empirical results show that the recognized convenience and speed constitute an important barrier to the payment process, along with the behavioral intention of users towards the QRIS payment. Other potential obstacles include an in-store selection of mobile payments, consumer ignorance of QRIS, old habits, image, and personal innovativeness of users' socially acceptable services and needs.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The goals were to understand pathways to transition to a cashless money-use behavior and to estimate a population’s inconvenience in accessing cash modes. Our model uses empirical evidence from a survey which studied the systemic and behavioral drivers of money-use behavior post-demonetisation. The model is able to illustrate outcomes depicting the pattern of transition to digital payments. We present a framework for optimal remonetisation considering infrastructure density and inconvenience experienced during transition by the population.

	abstract = {To combat the security risks associated with mobile and electronic payments, this paper proposes a novel system to perform electronic transactions and to appropriate the funds involved in them. This system, known as CodeCash, separates account funds into distinct, independent parts, with each of these represented by a cash sequence, or 20-digit distinct, randomly generated numerical series. Each associated with a value up to a specific amount determined by the bank, these cash sequences are given to the client to use as spendable funds, with their hashes being stored in the account and used for verification and value deduction during trans-actions. Utilising a non-device-verifiable pass-word on each transaction, the CodeCash system offers a secure method of transaction and transfer that, even if disrupted or attacked, yields mini-mal gains to the attacker, with the total amount of losses from theft being limited to the total value of cash sequences stored digitally on the particu-lar device. Furthermore, a method of storing cash sequences on offline hard drives is also introduced, with this method providing clients the option to shield funds from almost any known type of digital fraud. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

	abstract = {Technology diffusion has often been triggered unintendedly by crises and disasters, as witnessed in several cases including the demonetization cashcrisis surging mobile payment adoption in India. However, once the shock waves induced by the crisis event weakens over time, there exists a void that questions the sustenance of the technology whose diffusion was a ripple effect of the shock. This is seldom explored by the literature that focuses on the immediate aftermath of the crises. We address this limitation by examining the cash withdrawal patterns from ATMs in India post-demonetization for a continuous period of three years. The results provide strong empirical evidence to support our claims towards the dampening of demonetizations’ ripple effect on mobile payments. The theoretical contributions of the study add further to the existing literature on technology diffusion and technology adoption post-crises with a focus on the digital payment systems. The findings have implications for policymakers and government concerned with the digital economy, with cash emerging as an enemy overshadowing the growth of digital payment methods. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union lists counterfeiting of means of payment as one of the areas of particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension. At the European Union level a brand-new legislative instrument harmonising counterfeiting of means of payment has been adopted – the Directive (EU) 2019/713 on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. This Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the areas of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. Moreover, it facilitates the prevention of such offences, and the provision of assistance to and support for victims. The Directive is addressed to the Member States of the European Union. They shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31st May 2021. The contribution deals with criminalisation of the misuse of contactless payment cards with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. It is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on definition of Radio--Frequency Identification and payment cards with Radio-Frequency Identification. The second section focuses in detail on a new European Union approach to combat counterfeiting of means of payment addressed to its Member States – i.e. the Directive (EU) 2019/713 on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non--cash means of payment.

We begin with an extension of the Goodwin-Keen model incorporating time deposits, government bills, cash, and central bank reserves to the base model with loans and demand deposits, and use it to describe a fractional reserve banking system. We then characterize narrow banking by a full reserve requirement on demand deposits and describe the resulting separation between the payment system and lending functions of the resulting banking sector. By way of numerical examples, we explore the properties of fractional and full reserve versions of the model and compare their asymptotic properties. We find that narrow banking does not lead to any loss in economic growth when both versions of the model converge to a finite equilibrium, while allowing for more direct monitoring and prevention of financial breakdowns in the case of explosive asymptotic behavior. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The queuing theory was used to compare the performance of different payment system on Jagorawi toll roads as a case study. A model was developed to understand the pattern of queue and the relationship between queuing pattern, the toll's gate volume, and the number of booth. This study found that congestion occurred in the majority of the toll gate, which heavily due to unreliability of the booth services. Rather than increasing the number of booth, simulation of queuing models showed that optimization of toll gate could be achieved with GTO systems. The findings showed that the total number of cars and time in queue at cash payment system is almost 540% higher and annual congestion cost is almost 284% higher than GTO. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This extinction would be fraught with several insidious risks, as most of the benefits of the other payments instruments hinge on the continued possibility to use cash for retail transactions. This paper investigates how the use of different payments instruments may evolve over time in a two-sided market where different types of agents can choose which instrument(s) they would use. It shows that while more instruments can continue to be used indefinitely in equilibrium, there are also cases where one instrument becomes extinct and this new equilibrium can be stable, hence, irreversible. The paper also shows that very different outcomes can be reached from very similar initial conditions, and that a minor perturbation, such as the introduction, even on a small scale, of a new instrument can lead to the eventual extinction of one instrument. These results call for caution with the introduction of digital currencies and, more generally, with the digitalization of the financial system. © International Atlantic Economic Society 2024.},

We use the tourist test model (initially proposed by Rochet and Tirole), including tax evasion (Aurazo and Vasquez’s model) as an extra factor in the merchants’ decision between cash and card payments. Also, we revisit the existing empirical approaches and propose a new empirical approach, coined as the cash-flow approach, which assumes that small merchants estimate the overall cost in terms of the average ticket related to cash and card payments. Using a Survey on private costs of payment instruments conducted by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru in 2019, our estimates suggest that the tourist test threshold for debit cards is lower than the current interchange fee until 2019, even if tax evasion is not considered. Also, this study helps policymakers to better understand the factors around the merchants’ decision that may be considered to foster digital payments. © 2021 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

Findings: This study analyzes the effect of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on knowledge management, and also analyzes the effect of increasing knowledge management in increasing Islamic credit card users, as well as the role of knowledge management as mediation. Research limitations/implications: This study only examines Islamic credit cards by looking at the contribution of the role of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use knowledge management that are felt by users and prospective users of Islamic credit cards. Practical implications: The results of this study highlight the need for Islamic banks to provide and increase knowledge to understand and know well about Islamic credit cards, which can increase intentions to become new users. Originality/value: This research provides additional knowledge on Islamic credit cards, commonly referred to as bithaqah al-l’timan, as a means of payment and cash withdrawals in accordance with applicable regulations with reference to Islamic principles and policies by providing convenience, security and comfort for credit card users and for bank customers.

	abstract = {The emergence of digital payment systems has transformed how individuals conduct financial transactions, offering convenience, security, and efficiency. One groundbreaking innovation making waves in the Indian financial landscape is the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Existing work has explored how digital payments benefit a country's economy and GDP. However, our study explores how the introduction of UPI has influenced spending behavior among Indian users on an "individual" level. We gathered 235 valid survey responses encompassing diverse demographics and interviewed 20 survey respondents. Approximately 75% of the survey respondents reported increased spending due to UPI, with only 7% indicating reduced spending. Significantly, 91.5% of the respondents reported satisfaction with their UPI usage. Also, 95.2% of the survey respondents found making payments via UPI convenient. Our research also provides suggestions for UPI applications and various stakeholders to enhance digital payment systems, enabling users to make informed decisions and fostering responsible financial management. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

This study has examined the meaning of remittances for Indonesian migrant workers itself, through the perspective of phenomenology. This study aimed to reveal the social context and the meaning of remittances for migrant workers. This study used a qualitative method based on Alfred Schut's phenomenological perspective which states that the meaning cannot be separated from the "because" motives and "in order to" motives. Indonesian migrant workers who works abroad were research subjects. The data were collected by observation, by participation observation and documentation and by in-depth interviews. Nineteen subjects were determined as a unit of analysis. The study found the social background of the subject: they were in productive age have many brothers and sisters have a low level of education; their parents work as farmers; the female subjects worked as baby sitter and male subjects worked as a construction worker; building contractor; welders; electrical installers and factory worker. Based on the social context ('because' motives), the study found three patterns of departure payment, i.e., paid by salary reductions, loans payment and cash payment systems. The study also found three meanings of remittances, i.e., remittances as a substitute family economics as home ownership and as business investment. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

This study investigates the factors that influence the use of non-cash payments in 10 Asian countries, namely China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. A panel data is used in this study and the period 2016-2017 is considered. To address the ill-posed problem caused by limited observations, generalized maximum entropy (GME) estimator is employed. The purposes of the study are to identify the cross-country determinants of non-cash payments and prove that GME estimator is the most effective estimation method. The results of data show that online banking penetration and debit card penetration are important factors boosting non-cash payments. In addition, the sales of desktop-PCs and the number of individuals who overed 35 years are the determinants of non-cash payments. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this research project is to identify what effects the COVID-19 crisis has on people’s behavior with regard to contactless payment. It will be investigated whether the participants are increasingly using contactless payment options due to the COVID-19 crisis and what advantages and disadvantages are associated with the options. Since there are hardly any studies on this topic at the current time, this paper strives to fill this research gap. For this purpose, the authors have conducted a quantitative study. The hypothesis framework is derived from literature research. The resulting study was conducted with 528 participants. Study analysis show that the vast majority of hypotheses have a significant impact on the potential of contactless payment systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The aim of this study was to broaden the portfolio with a solution that assures the highest level of anonymity and is well applicable. An empirical design research study with prototyping and conceptual research with a proposed construct were employed for this purpose. As a result, the Activity-Based Payment (ABP) model was proposed. It introduces a different mode of completing a payment transaction based on performing specific activities on a web location indicated by the payee. The anonymity properties of the solution, as well as its performance and applicability have been evaluated showing its particular suitability to micropayment and small payment scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE 2024.},

Mobile wallet or digital wallet is one of the popular mediums of mobile payment system. There is much research that focuses on mobile wallets and consumers’ intention to use them. However, the mobile wallets are being increasingly replaced by UPI-based Payment Apps such as BHIM, PhonePe, and Google Pay, and little is known about the drivers for this adoption. Considering this gap, our study was conducted to understand the consumers’ behavioural intention with respect to UPI-based Payment Apps. Based on the literature review a conceptual model was proposed using an extended UTAUT2 framework. This was tested using a pan-India survey with 224 valid responses. Ordered logistic regression models were run in Stata to understand the impact of factors like Performance expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social influence, Facilitating conditions, Hedonic motivation, Price value, and User adoption on the intention to use UPI-based payment apps. Factors like Trust, Perceived security and Innovativeness were also included to get a better understanding of the consumer adoption perspective. It was found that Performance Expectancy, Price value, Trust and Perceived Security were significantly and positively related to behavioural intention. This is among the earliest studies in India to comprehensively model and empirically investigate factors driving the consumer adoption of UPI-based payment apps. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

It can be used as an instrument for making payments or purchases. Unlike paper cash, being a digital data, it may be easily replicated which gives a scope for duplicate spending of the cash certificates. Digital cash based payment systems can be classified as business critical systems as any failure may lead to loss of trust. Verification of critical requirements of such systems is therefore essential. In this paper, we present refinement approach for construction of the models of the digital cash based payment system using Event-B, wherein we verify how money atomicity property can be preserved in these systems. This ensures that money is neither generated nor destroyed in the electronic payment transactions. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

The objective of this study is to classify the m-wallet users using the cluster analysis and to analyse the differences between clusters based on satisfaction, engagement, and demographic characteristics. The cluster analysis results indicated that there are three segments based on users’ perception toward m-wallets: optimistic, suspecting, and pessimistic. This will also help in enhancing risk management and ease of convenience based on segments classified it will help decision makers to make strategic decision. The findings show that the users with positive perception toward m-wallets exhibit higher levels of satisfaction and engagement. The findings of this study further indicate that there is an association between internet experience, internet usage, online shopping and perception of m-wallet users.

Electronic money is world widely considered as new means of payment, and has been growing dramatically in both E-Commerce and M-Commerce for the last decade. However, due to the acceleration and enlargement effects, e-money could exert great impact to the country or even the international economic system in the future, and therefore should be carefully analysis and monitor. In this paper, we put the e-money into two categories: dependent and independent. The dependent e-money is simply the substitute of cash or deposit, and could not work without traditional money. The independent e-money, instead, could reproduce itself. We then give detailed discussion about current circulation modes of e-money, and analyze the potential impact from these two kinds of e-money on economy. We also propose a model-based simulation to perform quantitative analysis. In this way, we could take in-depth understanding of the development of e-money, as well as its impact to economy. © 2009 Binary Information Press March, 2009.},

In terms of safety and ease, electronic money calculation is the most promising calculation method in Internet. Payments with non-cash settlements are much more beneficial from all points of view. They greatly accelerate the payment process, simplify it, and help to reduce transaction costs. This is most clearly seen in the example, where the buyer and seller are located in a distance from each other in different countries. In development of the electronic money and online money transactions, a question occurs about the legal aspects and the rights of the heirs of the electronic payment accounts. This topic is relevant today, as almost every person every day faces in the electronic payments, but not everyone knows what they are and how they operate. The main objective of the study is to determine the legal status of the electronic payment accounts and the possibility of their inheritance by law. A lot of scientists devoted their works to the problems of studying the theoretical foundations of the electronic payment system, its place and role in the financial system, and its development. However, for the first time the legal matter of inheritance is considered from the practical aspect, wherein the novelty of the present study lays.

	abstract = {This article describes how electronic payments are financial transactions made over the internet for goods or services. In the digital era, the e-commerce industry has gone beyond the traditional in-store service due to the wide spread of internet-based shopping. Developed countries are greatly relying on e-commerce business and a sizable number of countries have shown concern in regard to the online payment cards such as credit cards, debit cards, e-cash, e-cheques, e-wallets and smart card security. The main downsides are concerns over privacy or a malicious attack and hence safeguard mechanisms are required to protect personal information from falling into the hands of intruders. Before commercializing electronic payment systems (EPS), security tests play a significant role in the software development life cycle to check whether the system is secure and it is safe to use. A resourceful approach covering security policies, secure coding, security attack prevention methodology, security testing tool, security testing metrics, security test case prioritization techniques and a model for effective project management methodology are presented in this article. Early detection and resolution of security weaknesses can be achieved with the authors’ proposed approach and would certainly reduce the time, effort and cost of a project. The proposed approach is likely the best-fit implementation of the payment industry, covering channels like B2C (Business to Consumer), C2C (Consumer to Consumer), C2B (Consumer to Business), B2B (Business to Business), People to People (P2P), G2C (Government to Citizen) and C2G (Citizen to Government).

	abstract = {The study provides a systematic analysis of central banks digital currencies (CBDC) as a new financial instrument. The main goal of the study was to review the CBDC economic development scenarios both domestically and internationally based on the assessment of the main features, advantages and risks of introducing this financial instrument into the modern monetary policy. The study considers the following three main characteristics of CBDC: a tool for domestic settlements, a single unit of account for the economic bloc of countries and a universal international digital currency. Each of these models was considered by the author in terms of the motivation of market participants, degree of readiness of the project and its compatibility with the existing financial system. Differentiation of models, depending on the payment architecture, the technological parameters and the implementation scale, allowed to conclude that currently there is no common understanding of the CBDC nature and economic advantages neither for individual countries nor for the international community as a whole. Noting the technological advantages of digitalization of the financial system, states are yet to answer the question of the CBDC implementation scale. Will it replace cash domestically or will it become a single international payment instrument? And are states ready today to consider such a possibility? The author concludes the study by substantiating the idea that in the next 35 years interest in the digital financial services sector will grow mainly in developing countries looking for a qualitative leap in the development of the digital financial services. As for the developed countries, those are neither objectively nor subjectively ready to change the already built and wellproven financial system, and therefore, given their weak interest in paradigm shifts, digital currency in the next 10 years will not be able to provide an alternative to the US dollar as a unit of international settlements. At the same time, there is a high probability of the CBDC development as a means of payment within the economic bloc of countries provided the unity of purpose of its participants. © 2021 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

	abstract = {This study analyzes existing consumption tax systems and proposes a new cyberconsumption tax policy called the Consumer-Delivered Sales Tax (CDS tax) for use in the electronic commerce environment. The CDS tax has the characteristics of a sales tax, but is remitted directly by the consumer without the intervention of the supplier. Seven criteria are laid out for use in designing an acceptable cybertax system: The system should be equitable and simple, ensure user confidence, prevent tax evasion and economic distortion, maintain a fair balance among countries, and not introduce a new form of taxation. All of these goals are satisfied by a version of the CDS tax termed the Canonical CDS tax. The taxation agency in the supplier's country imposes the Canonical CDS tax on consumers in a manner that is consistent in both physical-and cyberspace. The merchant's software issues a tax bill to the consumer's personal computer (PC) together with the bill for the consumer's purchase. The consumer pays the total amount, and the tax portion of the payment is transferred to the account of the consumer's tax agency in a consumer-designated bank. The study shows that the Canonical CDS tax system can be implemented using ordinary electronic payment systems, such as electronic fund transfers, electronic credit cards, and electronic cash. It also demonstrates that the Canonical CDS tax system can coexist with traditional consumption tax systems, such as the sales tax and the value-added tax.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The debate around automation through digital technologies has gathered traction in line with the advancement of Industry 4.0. Blockchain-powered construction progress payment has emerged as an area that can benefit from such automation. However, the challenges inherent in real-time construction payment processes cannot be solely mitigated by blockchain. Including building information modeling (BIM)-based schedule information stored in decentralized storage linked with a smart contract (SC) can allow the efficient administration of payments. Accordingly, this study aims to present an integrated BIM-blockchain system (BBS) to administer decentralized progress payments in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach is adopted, including an extensive literature review, development of the integrated BBS, and a case study with 13 respondents to test and validate the BBS. This study proposes a BBS that extracts the invoices from BIM and pushes them to the decentralized app (dApp) for digital payment to the contractor through the Ethereum blockchain. The Solc npm package was used to compile the backend SC. Next.js was used to create the front end of the dApp. The Web3 npm package is paramount in developing a dApp. A total of 13 construction professionals working on the case study project were engaged through a questionnaire survey to comment on and validate the proposed BBS. A descriptive analysis was conducted on the case study data to apprehend the responses of expert professionals. Findings: The proposed BBS creates an SC, enables sender verification, checks contract complaints, verifies bills, and processes the currency flow based on a coded payment logic. After passing the initial checks, the bill amount is processed and made available for the contractor to claim. Every activity on dApp leaves its trace on the blockchain ledger. A control mechanism for accepting or rejecting the invoice is also incorporated into the system. The case study-based validation confirmed that the proposed BBS could increase payment efficiency (92.3%), tackle financial misconduct (84.6%), ensure transparency and audibility (92.4%), and ensure payment security (61%) in construction projects. A total of 46.2% of respondents were skeptical of the BBS because of its dependency on cryptocurrencies. A further 23.1% of respondents indicated that the price fluctuation of cryptocurrencies is a major barrier to BBS adoption. Others highlighted the absence of legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies’ usage. Originality/value: This study opens the avenue for the application of dApp for autonomous contract management and progress payments, which is flexible with applications across various construction processes. Overall, it is a potential solution to the endemic problem of cash flow that has devastating consequences for all project stakeholders. This is also aligned with the goals of Industry 4.0, where process automation is a key focus. The study provides a practice application for automated progress payments that can be leveraged in construction projects across the globe. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The physician payment system is a focus of potential reform in the United States. The authors explored the effects of the military's method of physician payment on physicians' returns on educational investment for several specialties. Method: This retrospective, observational study used national data from 2003 and standard financial techniques to calculate the net present value-the current value of an expected stream of cash flows at a particular rate of interest-of the educational investments of medical students in ten 30-year career paths: either military or civilian careers in internal medicine, psychiatry, gastroenterology, general surgery, or orthopedics. Results: At a 5% discount rate, in the civilian world, the lowest return on an educational investment accrued to psychiatrists ($1.136 million) and the highest to orthopedists ($2.489 million), a range of $1.354 million. In the military, the lowest returns accrued to internists ($1.377 million) and the highest to orthopedists ($1.604 million); however, the range was only $0.227 million, one-sixth that found in the civilian sector. The authors also found that most military physicians do not remain in the military for their full careers. Conclusions: Choosing a military career substantially decreases the net present value of an educational investment for interventionalists, but it does so only modestly for primary care physicians. Further, a military career path markedly diminishes specialty-specific variation in the net present values of educational investment. Adopting a military structure for engaging medical students might help reverse the current trend of declining interest in primary care. Copyright © by the Association of American Medical Colleges.},

However, mobile payments are rarely used for making face-to-face payments, with concerns about anonymity, security, and usability. This paper proposes a face-to-face mobile payment protocol that addresses these concerns. To address anonymity and security concerns, the proposed protocol uses unique information for the payment transaction, such as the location and the time, and introduces two procedures for optimizing the matching time slots and exchanging random numbers when needed, to secure the transactions without exposing the seller's or the buyer's personal identification. To address usability concerns, the proposed protocol optimizes the parameters for the two introduced procedures to match the seller-buyer pairs, depending on the number of the people involved in the mobile payments, the delays caused by human operations with the mobile phones, mobile communication, and so on. Experimental results prove that the proposed protocol is practical, solving the addressed concerns. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The proposed system helps individual customers to get the actual bill after any discount or deduction of their purchase. Customers have to log in to their account for billing and pay the bill using any digital payment method. This system is developed by considering security for avoiding robbery and this system is also user-friendly. It minimizes the time in purchasing and making free to the customer by standing in a long queue by ensuring the customer comfort and minimizing the headache of barcode scanning and eliminating waging of billers, thereby accomplishing both customer and shopkeeper demands. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Behavioral household finance shows that people are often more willing to spend when using less tangible forms of money like debit cards or digital payments than when spending in cash. We show that this “payment effect” cannot be generalized to mobile money. We surveyed families in rural Northwest Bangladesh, where mobile money is mainly received from relatives working in factories. The surveys were embedded within an experiment that allows us to control for the relationships between senders and receivers of mobile money. The finding suggests that the source of funds matters, and mobile money is earmarked for particular purposes and thus less fungible than cash. In contrast to the expectation of greater spending, the willingness to spend in the rural sample was lower by 24 to 31 percent. In urban areas, where the sample does not receive remittances on net, there are no payment effects associated with mobile money. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction to The Problem: The rapid technological progress at this time has greatly influenced the development of the payment system in Indonesia. Innovations in electronic payment instruments have developed into more usable forms. Currently, like the other country, Indonesia is developing an electronic payment instrument known this day as e-money. Bank Rakyat Indonesia is one of the e-money issuer institutions, which issues Brizzi as an alternative non-cash payment instrument. The problem faced is that there are still many people who do not want to use e-money, especially Brizzi because they do not know the validity of using Brizzi e-money. Purpose/Objective Study: This research aims to study the importance of Brizzi E-Money as a means of payment. Design/Methodology/Approach: This research uses empirical juridical research methods to answer the validity of using Brizzi e-money as a payment method. This study uses primary data and secondary data. The primary data in this research are obtained from interviews at Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Merlung Branch. Other than that is secondary data collected through library research. Findings: This research shows that the existence of e-money continues to experience significant development from 2009 until 2019. The legality of using Brizzi e-money and other e-money in Indonesia has been recognized as a legal payment instrument as regulated in the PBI on Electronic Money.

	abstract = {The emergence and spread of virtual assets worldwide are at the center of many researchers’ attention. Virtual assets began to be used for settlement, capital accumulation, and speculative income, which creates competition with state fiat money, to the state monopoly of the central banķ on money issuance and potentially rise a threat to financial stability. The purpose of the article is to assess the current state and development potential of both state and non-state virtual assets, their role in money circulation, and the potential impact on the monetary and credit system of Uķraine in the context of the possible launch of the central banķ digital currency - the e-hryvnia. The article presents the main forms of virtual assets and defines their characteristics, evaluates the possibility of their usage for settlements, and the potential for partial or complete replacement of fiat money in cash or non-cash forms. It is proven that nowadays the main restraining factor for the acquisition of money functions by virtual assets are the insufficient prevalence of technological means for carrying out transactions, the high volatility of their prices, and legislative limits. It is determined that technically some retail virtual assets can acquire all money qualities and conceptually differ only in the issuer and the system of centralization: public or private issuer, centralized or decentralized system. Furthermore, it has been proven that the introduction of the e-hryvnia into circulation as a monetary policy tool with interest accrual would significantly strengthen the interest channel of monetary transmission, contribute to the achievement of central banķ targets, and hence to non-inflationary monetization of the economic growth. At the same time, the introduction of the third form of money would probably give rise to new risķs, which are proposed to be mitigated by proper parameterization of the new form of money. © 2022 by the author(s).},

In the benchmark model with only CBDC, entrepreneurs can deposit their idle CBDC and banks can hold CBDC to satisfy the reserve requirement. CBDC and bank deposits become complements. A higher CBDC interest rate always promotes investment and may or may not reduce bank lending, because the higher return on CBDC encourages entrepreneurs to accumulate more CBDC and deposit more. More deposits could in turn lead to more bank lending. The interest rate on reserves and the reserve requirement ratio can be effective policy tools that affect bank lending and investment. We consider extensions where cash and interest-bearing CBDC can coexist. The coexistence may require the central bank to adjust the CBDC interest rate or the interest rate on reserves. Our results suggest that the relationship between CBDC and bank deposits are crucial for understanding the effects of CBDC on banking and the macroeconomy. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This raises the ques-tion whether the ‘digital euro’, as proposed by the European Central Bank, is actually needed, and if so, where the demand comes from. This opinion paper examines this question from five perspectives — structural, regulatory, monetary, financial and geo-political — and compares the proposed features with the actual benefits. These five perspectives lead to five antagonisms: (1) centralisation of the current two-tier financial system vs market-driven innovations, (2) a stand-alone digital euro vs the comprehensive European Markets in Crypto-assets regulation, (3) the attractiveness of a digital euro vs its cash-like lim-itations, (4) a digital euro ‘free of charge’ vs the question of funding, and (5) a competition of cur-rencies vs a competition of payment instruments. While other parts of the world plan to develop innovations with automated payments integrated in cross-industry process chains, the debate about a digital euro seems to forget the ‘voice of the cus-tomer’. With this in mind, this paper suggests that a digital euro (as currently proposed) does not provide tangible benefits, and that Europe needs more options for digital payments if it is to stay competitive in today’s global economy. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

The use of portable electronic gadgets with high-speed internet and mobile networking mechanisms have offered the user to access and perform a financial transaction. The technological advancement in wireless technology has enabled the mobile devices as the prime component in a digital economy where the user can execute all the transactions. However, the attackers are finding the various ways to identify those transaction details and is leading to security concern for both the mobile application developers and also the users of it. Thus, this paper considers all the security concerns of mobile payment systems which fails to offer secure customer verification during the transaction. This paper introduces a hardware-based bidirectional secure payment system by using a biometric authentication mechanism at both the ends of the seller and buyer. This system eliminates the physical requirement of cash for all the transactions and resolves the identity needs during each transaction. The outcomes suggest that the system fulfills all the secure payment system and it takes approximately less than 30Â s of time to complete the entire process of the transaction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Despite the fact that the last relevant reform on the matter dates from 2010, there is still no clear criterion when it comes to interpreting some criminal behaviors that use these instruments. Directive (EU) 2019/713 updates the punitive panorama regarding means of payment other than cash. Spain, with months of delay, has recently prepared the Draft Project with which it intends to comply with this rule. In this sense, it is necessary to analyze the behaviors currently punished in our legislation to determine the need to reform the Penal Code and, especially, the adequacy of the proposal made with European requirements and with our limiting principles of state coercion. © 2021 Jesus Barquin Universidad de Granada.

Some of the applications of BDA include market segmentation, sales forecasting, weather forecasting, payment fraud detection, crop diseases detection, e-commerce analysis and users purchasing recommendation and others. The application of BDA is not only left for economically developed regions. It is also important for resource-constrained environments. In this study, challenges of identifying and utilizing big data analytics in the resource-constrained environment in the case of Ethiopia have been explored using some case. The case studies considered potential industries that can generate big data in Ethiopia. Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation, Agricultural Transformation Agency, Payment systems like Hello Cash and Ethiopian Educational Networks (EthERNet) were considered as a case study. In the study, a qualitative grounded approach has been applied. Data was collected using a semi-structured interview approach. As data analysis result and discussion indicated that even if the selected potential industries have been generated big data they are not using it fully for the purpose of decision making. Potential challenges were identified in the identifying and utilizing of BDA in a resource-constrained environment. Some of these areas: lack of BDA awareness, data integration challenge, lack of skilled experts in the area, lack of data correctness and completeness, lack of standardized data registry, lack of leadership and management skill, issue of data privacy and infrastructure challenges including a huge volume of storage device constraint. Based on the identified challenges of BDA implementations in this study and possible application areas of BDA in those industries, a conceptual framework of the study were formulated. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

This shift has caused many companies to create e-wallets and compete with each other in retaining loyal customers. This research was conducted to determine the factors that influence e-Customer Loyalty and Online Customer Satisfaction with Sakuku e-wallet users, one of the developing digital payment instruments in Indonesia. The research method used is path analysis using a questionnaire distributed to 202 respondents randomly. The results showed that e-Service Quality had no significant effect on e-Customer Loyalty (H1), while Online Customer Experience and Online Customer Satisfaction had a significant effect on e-Customer Loyalty (H2 and H5). This finding indicates that increasing e-service quality has no significant impact on increasing e-customer loyalty. This means that if a business only improves e-service quality, it will not directly make loyal customers. To get loyal customers, a business has to make its customers satisfied first. Therefore, the factors that make customers feel satisfaction need to get business attention. Other findings are e-Service Quality and Online Customer Experience have a significant effect on e-Customer Satisfaction and Online Customer Satisfaction can mediate the Online Customer Experience on e-Customer Loyalty, but Online Customer Satisfaction has not been able to mediate e-Service Quality on e-Customer Loyalty for Sakuku users in Jakarta. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

Information communication technology en-abled the transformation of our banking system from paper to virtual mode, facilitating speedy and secure fund transfers. Post-demonetization (8 November 2016), the cashless economy got a boost, and about 98% of transactions have become cashless. A cashless policy empowers industries, leading to an increase in employment opportunities and reducing cash-oriented fraud. The Reserve Bank of India-Digital Payments Index was recorded at 349.30 as of March 2022 against 304.06 for September 2021, indicating significant growth, rapid adoption and deepening of digital payment across the nation. During the financial year 2021–22, digital transactions surged to 7195 crores, with the value in-creasing to Rs 17.44 billion. There is a strong need to make policies for protection against cyber-attacks, encourage digital literacy, and ensure adequate rural penetration of internet connectivity and banking infrastructure, with awareness among rural masses to strengthen organized indigenous markets.

When traveling with many visitors, the cash payment system is not very effective, RFID technology will help with its advantages that can be detected by radio frequency. Coupled with the android application that is used to order food, to reduce a queue. RFID is presented in the form of a Smart Bracelet that is supported by the QR Code, which is the QR Code used to login to the application. Smart bracelets are used as a means of payment, where payment transactions will be stored in the android application. With this concept, a network connection is needed to facilitate the transaction system, as a communication supporter, the Tourist Complex is equipped with a communication network, namely WLAN which is realized by several access points placed at several location points. So the systems built will run exact and suitable. Thus the Sunan Bonang Tourist Complex will form a Smart Tourist town based IoT.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Blockchains provide high operator-independent security and enable central banks to outsource CBDC operations while retaining control over the amount of circulating money. Scalability of blockchain depends on the possibility of decomposing the blockchain. We study how the choice of money scheme: accounts, bills, or unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) influences the existence of secure and decomposable blockchain implementations of CBDC. We give formal definitions to money schemes, their decompositions, atomic decompositions inspired from the properties of blockchain implementations. For our formalism, we use tools from universal algebra and category theory. We present a general decomposition theory and conditions under which money schemes have atomic decompositions. Bill money schemes meet these conditions but account and UTXO schemes do not. Bill schemes enable scalable and secure implementations of CBDC while the more traditional schemes have some issues. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Three categories of payment types (cash, electronic payment and anonymous payment schemes) are available. Germany is one of the last countries in Europe with a high level of cash usage. Some economists have gone so far as to propose abolishing cash completely, because it supports the black economy, it helps to avoid negative interest rates and its handling is expensive and inefficient. But abolishing cash is not the silver bullet that some claim it would be. People would start turning to substitutes for cash, maybe even creating a new informal currency. This would reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of such a move, and it might even create new opportunities for criminal activities and the inflation of speculative bubbles. Moreover, if we regard privacy in monetary transactions as a social value, eliminating notes and coins as a means of payment may have serious side effects for citizens. While anonymous electronic payments are available in theory, abolishing cash would severely harm individuals’ privacy in practice. © 2015, ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The brunt of the economic consequences of the restrictions has been faced majorly by the aviation, tourism and hospitality sector. Nevertheless, many other small/medium/large services are facing the economic consequences. With the lockdown allowing mostly the essential sectors to continue to function, the spending of disposable income is expected to reduce drastically. The cash withdrawals at ATMs is a prominent measure of the general retail economic activity. We show its impact along with the impact on other digital payment modes such as Debit/Credit cards, UPI, IMPS, NEFT and RTGS. We present the extent to which COVID-19 and the subsequent nationwide lockdown and slow unlocking, during April-May-June 2020, has impacted the financial transactions in the country. The sheer slowdown of the economy gets depicted by the drastic reduction of retail payment activities in the country. Based on transaction data during Q4 of FY20 and Q1 of FY21, we relate the economic impact of COVID induced lockdown and its subsequent relaxations. Although the economy is likely to suffer in FY21, we have begun to see some form of cautious and calibrated opening up of economic activity, as we see payment transactions picking up starting June 2020. The positive effect of COVID can be seen in form of increased levels of BHIM-UPI usage, as more and more people learn to use this mobile app-based, easy to use, digital mode of payment. © 2020, Society of Statistics, Computer and Applications.

This paper designed and implemented a smart shuttle system to help the University of Ghana students locate the shuttle's position and estimate the arrival time via web and mobile applications. The system integrates an electronic payment system via mobile money, credit or debit card, and web tokens to allow students to pay for their rides without physical cash. This system comprises an integration of hardware and software modules. A real-time Google map and Arduino-based vehicle tracking system is implemented with the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). An Arduino UNO controls the GPS module to get the geographic coordinates at regular time intervals. The GSM module transmits the shuttle's location (latitude and longitude) to the web and mobile applications. Finally, the web and mobile application use Google Maps to show the shuttle's location in real-time, making it possible for students to monitor a moving shuttle using their smartphones or laptops. The integrated payment system within the mobile app allows students to pay for a ride in the shuttle using credit cards, mobile money, and electronic tokens. The developed system was extensively tested for the various functionalities to ensure that the system was fully operational.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Merely mobile payment services are not sufficient for any of these objectives, and there is a joint interest in enabling mobile credit and saving services. It is widely recognized that successful adoption of mobile saving and credit services is dependent on a digital solution; it requires a transition from current cash based over-the-counter (OTC) solutions to future digital accounts (mobile wallets/mWallets). Firstly, this paper reviews previous research on MFS, secondly it summarizes the global industry picture for MFS today, and thirdly, we provide key learnings from the successful Easypaisa case in Pakistan. MFS can also be characterized as implementations in complex ecosystems with lots of tension and dependent on local circumstances. The unique Easypasia case we present is a further proof of the complex processes and events that moves a MFS implementation from one state to another. It also shows how Easypaisa's significant jump from cash-based to digital mWallet solutions was triggered by a governmental regulation on ID requirements for mobile subscriptions. The ecosystem approach and significance of local conditions is vital to be aware of when the industry turns to new aspects of MFS and when technologies such as blockchain may disrupt the current situation. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid nature of the modernization of monetary turnover, accompanied by geopolitical risks against the background of post-pandemic economic recovery and the regionalization process, no longer just arouses the discursive interest of society, but becomes an indispensable condition of the new reality. The process of money turnover transformation by introducing digital currencies into circulation in the wave of digitalization among world powers lagging behind the evolving environment of the cryptocurrency industry is developing into a process of formalization of metaverses and penetrates deeper into the socio-economic reality. The problem of the Russian practice of developing the payment environment consists in its catching-up character, caused by the spontaneous formation of the digital society, resulting in the expansion of the scope of alternative finance outside the legal field. The purpose of the paper is to determine the inherent attributes of the digital trusted environment necessary to ensure digital ruble turnover, based on an empirical study of society's perceptions about the prospects for using the digital form of the national monetary unit by representatives of various generations. We used systematization, grouping, comparative and content analysis, surveys, and the quota method to achieve the paper's purpose. The survey involved 35, 327 residents from different regions. As a result, the authors revealed the low level of readiness of society for the introduction of the digital ruble as a substitute for cash and cryptocurrency. The paper focuses on the need for an integrated approach to the disclosure of the digital ruble's value and benefits, which contributes to its successful launch and promotion in the market. The results of the research highlight the importance of correspondence in the digital ruble category “digital currencies”, and also the impossibility of making incorrect decisions in the transformation of money turnover, which leads to the growth of risks of digital inequality, the clash of interests of certain groups of the population in the prevailing behavioral patterns in the form of a cautious attitude to digital finance with insufficient financial literacy. © 2023 Authors.

This indicator demonstrates that the customers of public and private sector banks show a preference for cash transactions over non-cash transactions, while the customers of foreign banks prefer non-cash transactions over cash transactions. The estimated cash preference ratio shows a declining trend over time, in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s pro-gress towards a less cash-dependent economy. The empirical results reveal a sharp decline in cash preference during the period of demonetisation; however, cash preference marginally increased during the post-demonetisation period. The study also finds that customers of public sector banks have the highest cash preference, followed by the customers of private sector banks. The authors propose the introduction of an oversight mechanism to identify the root causes of high cash preference, and the provision of remedial measures, such as investment in the infrastructure to support non-cash transactions and edu cating customers about the benefits of a cashless economy.-. © Henry Stewart Publications,.},

However, due to logical, conceptual similarity, the notion of “payment technology” is blurred in the studies of payment systems. Hence, there is a need to form the conceptual apparatus of payment technologies and to identify the features in the functioning and implementation of payment technologies. Due to the analysis of structural elements of the payment industry and identifying areas of payment technology used in the mechanism of retail settlements, it seems possible to form the features of payment technology. Their comparison with a number of principles and criteria of functioning in the future seems possible expediency of development of new technologies, which characterizes the practical significance of the research. The purpose of the research is to form a conceptual framework in the field of payment technology, namely, the definition of the concept of “payment technology” and the identification of features of their functioning, as well as the classification by analyzing the opinions of scientific researchers in the field of payment systems, banking and sciences related to financial technology. The originality of the research is that we formed a theoretical and methodological base of research in the field of payment systems, payment technologies and financial management of companies, industries that directly depend on the level of development of payment technologies, including retailers and payment service providers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Mobile device ownership has increased across the globe making it the highest adopted platform. With the rapid technology advancements on the smartphones, improvements on the telecommunication networks, falling handset prices and reducing connectivity costs has resulted in mobile devices becoming the primary instrument which our daily lives revolve around transforming how consumers search, evaluate and procure goods or services. Payments are rapidly moving towards mobile while the commerce been transitioning to mobile. The recent developments in information communication technology has played a pivotal role in facilitating the modern digital businesses by reducing time required to perform transactions between buyers and sellers thus creating different customer behaviours. This new digital business paradigm has also resulted in making physical barriers such as distance and time irrelevant. This paper presents an innovative digital merchant platform (including payments) currently been deployed in Sri Lanka. iPay is a novel solution that operates on the comparatively low cost of mobile devices to increase financial inclusivity in developing economies. One of the key challenges faced in such economies is that only a comparatively small population, concentrated in urban areas have access to banking facilities. There exists a vast potential in the much greater proportion of the population who are primarily engaged in agrarian based activities and cottage industries. The simplified nature of iPay allows this segment to be part of the banking system. iPay also enables the complete ‘digitalisation’ of merchants, with just a smartphone and an internet connection. This allows merchants to become part of a growing digital economy, and enabling other digital ‘strategies’ such as marketing campaigns to improve stock control and management, aiding merchants dealing with perishable goods. Cash accounts for bulk of financial transactions in Sri Lanka, which is primarily due to individuals’ not been able to access money in the banking system. iPay solves this problem by enabling access to funds ‘on-the-go’ which eases the burden of cash management on the economy as well as greatly reduces the risk of cash losses. The nature of the iPay increases financial inclusivity, and helps to alleviate poverty by increasing employment opportunities across the economy. Major percentage of the population in developing countries have limited reach to credit, hindering their growth potential. Banks and financial institutes are unable to grant credit facilities, as they are not operating in the banking system, resulting-in the inability to make a concrete assessment of a person’s credit worthiness. iPay will be able to solve this by performing complex analytics on individuals’ payment patterns in order to assist financial institutions calculate a ‘credit index’. This availability of credit would greatly assist the rural population in developing cottage industries, which would in-turn provide employment as well as earn foreign exchange. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

In the first case, the data was aggregated weekly, in the second case, monthly. The values of the Hurst index obtained for the two series studied turned out to be significantly different: for LPS it turned out to be close to 0.5 (the current value has little effect on the future), and for an individual agent it is 0.73 (a trend-resistant series with a tendency to increase in value with time). Differences in the values are explained by the fact that the two studied months accounted for the full life cycle of the LPS, and the annual period for the agent outside the LPS is only a small part of its life cycle. © 2018 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Theoretical basis: The learning objectives aim to provide an understanding of the changing nature of consumer payments and the impact upon both businesses and consumers. This can be achieved by examining the case through the lens of stakeholder theory, which posits that businesses are “responsible … to ‘those groups and individuals who can affect or be affected by their actions.’” Collectively, those groups and individuals are known as stakeholders and they commonly include “customers, employees, suppliers, communities and financiers.” In addition to creating value for the owners, businesses should also consider how they can create value for each of their other stakeholders (Freeman et al., 2010, p. 9). In addition, consistent with the theory of management control systems (Chenhall, 2003), the automatic processing of cashless transactions enables businesses to more efficiently record their earnings, commission payments (if applicable) and monitor cash collections. As all data are captured in an electronic format, they can easily understand their sales and profitability through user-friendly and visually appealing dashboards. This, in turn, enables them to obtain a more accurate and timely view of their business and they can appropriately adjust their operations and strategy as a result of this information. Finally, cashless payments enable more accurate and efficient reporting of information to taxing authorities, which decreases the possibility that the affected parties would underreport income and underpay taxes. This is similarly consistent with the theory of management control systems (Chenhall, 2003) because the improved systems of financial reporting assure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Research methodology: This case was developed using both primary and secondary data sources. The authors interviewed the participants in London and the secondary data collection used relevant sources from appropriate literature and the popular press. Case overview/synopsis: In London, consumer transactions were as plentiful as the eight million people who lived there. While cash was considered “king” in retail, cash payments dropped by 15% across the UK in 2017, and debit and credit cards became the predominant payment method (Kollewe, 2018). Cash represented only 40% of customer payments and was expected to drop to 21% by 2026 (Lyons et al., 2018). This was likely driven by contactless payments whereby consumers preferred the speed and ease of being able to “tap and go.” As businesses were charged fees to accept credit card payments, many expected that small businesses would insist on cash for small transactions. Instead, some banished cash completely. Insights from two London businesses helped explain why some were dropping cash and completely embracing cards. Complexity academic level: This case can be used in a variety of undergraduate level courses to discuss trends in customer payment methods and the decisions of some businesses to completely abandon cash. Some example courses and suggested supporting materials include the following: • Consumer behavior • Entrepreneurial finance • Survey of accounting • Introduction to financial accounting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The asymmetries in the implementation of the Covid-19 mobility restrictions across the Spanish provinces serves as a quasi-natural experiment. The findings show that the severity of the mobility restrictions had an impact on payment choices. Individuals in areas with more stringent restrictions were less likely to use cash. The effect of the mobility restrictions on cash usage was larger among those with lower financial education. However, the severity of the mobility restrictions did not significantly affect the adoption of the most sophisticated digital payment methods like digital wallets. Consumer concerns about Covid-19 transmission through cash did not drive these results. Using a recent survey conducted in a post-pandemic context, where mobility restrictions have been lifted, the impact of mobility restrictions on cash usage has persisted. The main results hold after several robustness tests. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {How should payment systems of means-tested benefits be designed to improve the financial situation of needy recipients most effectively? We study this question in the context of mandatory health insurance in Switzerland, where recipients initially receive either a cash transfer or subsidized insurance premiums (a form of in-kind transfer). A federal reform in 2014 forced cantons (i.e. states) to universally switch to in-kind provision. We exploit this setting based on a difference-in-differences design, analyzing eight years of rich individual-level accounting data and applying a machine learning approach to identify cash recipients prior to the reform. We find that switching from cash to in-kind transfers persistently reduces the likelihood of late premium payments by about 20% and of government debt collection for long-term missed payments by approximately 12%. There is no evidence for a negative spillover effect on the timely payment of the non-subsidized co-pay bills for health services after the regime change.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In contrast to e-banking, e-wallets have made allowance for the customers to pay cash directly through their mobile device which can be spent online and in-store as well. The application of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) represents features such as usefulness and easy access which attracts the users in terms of security and trust. Despite the leads that e-wallet possesses over the banking applications, there prevails certain shortcomings in terms of security such as fragile encryption mechanism, poor session maintenance, threats over offloading, tampering the proof of the receipt over a transaction, personification of the original identity, etc. Majority of the ongoing researches elevates the security of the e-wallet channel by including location-based security, strengthening the app security, appending block chain technology and more. However, a concrete novel secure mobile wallet framework lags the mandate to overcome all the aforementioned threats. In this paper, a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of e-wallet is studied. Also, an in-depth review of various encryption schemes and its outcomes, various offloading mechanisms, threats over e-wallet applications and its remedial measures are discussed in an aspiration to reach the expected solution. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

	abstract = {Technology in today’s world has wholly modified payment methods from cash to digital or card payments. Therefore, in these situations, the authentication system is essential for guaranteeing the legitimacy of a transaction. This is because such payment systems are susceptible to fraud or false transactions. As a result, numerous techniques to authenticate the user’s credentials have been developed and practiced. We use machine learning to predict the fate of the transaction by training our model on past or existing transactional data. Despite the fact that these solutions boost security, they could not be more reliable. These systems may predict that the transaction is legitimate when it’s not. This paper intends to illustrate the idea that helps to increase the credibility of such a machine learning system with the help of integration with a face recognition system. The final decision of whether the transaction is fraudulent or not will be taken based on outputs obtained by the machine learning module and face recognition module. The face recognition module uses the LBPH algorithm. To decide the threshold in the face recognition module and test it, we experimented with 30 users for fraudulent and non-fraudulent face data. For the machine learning module, to select the algorithm to use in our system, we performed a comparative analysis between different algorithms and chose the one that had the best performance on the input dataset. In this way, a multilevel authentication system is proposed to help increase a transaction’s truthfulness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The government has realised this through Government’s National Non-Cash Movement to increase its adoption. This is then followed up by advocating its adoption massively. However, for this movement to be a success, ensuring its continued use is critical. Various studies have attempted to contribute to this issue. Incorporating game elements into the application that brings benefits and satisfaction to its user is envisaged as one of the most feasible ways. This study, therefore, sets out to investigate the effects of gamification on the m-payment application, which drive the intention to continued use by employing the Uses dan Gratification Theory (UGT). A total of 826 m-payment users were gathered to be analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. The results show that utilitarian, hedonic and social gratifications have significant effects on the continuance usage intention of m-payment. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature by showing that gamification applied in the payment significantly affects the m-payment continuance usage intention. Practically, this research informs the m-payment providers to maintain the gamification elements in their applications to ensure their sustainable use. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the factors influencing the adoption of mobile payment (MP) systems in Mauritius. This was achieved by identifying Mauritian consumers' shopping patterns and preferences and their perceptions of Mauritian MP systems. The demographics of this study revealed that of the 84 responses received, the majority were male respondents between 18 and 24. Although most respondents were from the rural areas of Mauritius, they preferred shopping at malls, with a small majority preferring online shopping. Cash and debit cards are currently the main forms of payment adopted for in-store shopping, while credit and debit cards are the most adopted for online shopping. Cash and debit cards are the preferred payment methods for in-store shopping, while credit cards and MP systems are preferred for online shopping. The most popular application (app) adopted for MP is the Juice app. The amount participants pay for using MP systems range from MRU 10 to 1000. The statistical analysis of the perceptions of Mauritian consumers of the adoption of MP systems revealed that they found MP systems easy to use and useful. While they indicated that MP systems are secure, concerns were raised about the risks associated with unnecessary and fraudulent charges associated with MP systems. Social influence had little effect on the adoption of MP systems. MP was adopted more where it was compatible with the participant's lifestyle or shopping behaviour. Participants who displayed a keen interest in technology adopted MPs more frequently. Overall, however, most participants indicated that they intend to continue adopting MP systems in the future. The respondents further expressed a positive attitude towards MPs, especially identifying that MP systems are better than cash. They seem to be more motivated to adopt MP systems if there are rewards associated with their usage. A model of the factors that influence the adoption of MP systems was then proposed. © 2021 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using panel data estimation techniques and controlling for, inter alia, firm and deal specific factors, we find no evidence that financial slack has a statistically significant influence on the means of payment. However, firms with high leverage have a higher propensity to acquire a target by using cash. Furthermore, we document a weak association between financial slack and acquirer post-acquisition performance. When we classify firms in terms of the degree of financial slack and considering the method of payment, we find that firms with a low degree of financial slack generate negative long-run operating returns. These results are consistent across the method of payment used. Conversely, firms with a high degree of financial slack that use cash and a combination of financing sources yield positive and statistically significant long-run operating returns. We further show that undervalued firms are significantly more likely to use cash as a form of payment. © 2020, © 2020 Investment Analysts Society of South Africa.},

As these banks cannot issue loans and credit cards, but both current and savings accounts can be operated by such banks. Money is the life blood of every economy. Now-a-days cash transactions are much simpler due to the popularization of internet, smart phones and other digital technologies. Therefore most of the transactions were cashless and if these practices will continue as it is then in future physical form of currencies will no longer be a king. Privacy, security and convenience are the factors which influence the users while using the facility of payment banks. The last decade has seen tremendous growth in use of internet and mobile phone in India. Increasing use of internet, mobile penetration and government initiative such as Digital India are acting as catalyst which leads to exponential growth in use of digital payment. But still many people are there who were not ready to accept this system of banking as they have a thinking of being cheated.

	abstract = {Mobile payments are increasing globally as a strong alternative to cash. The Government of India has taken several measures to make Indians use payment modes other than cash—the most dramatic example of that being the recent demonetization exercise. An important question here is what drove peoples’ choice of payment modes immediately after demonetization and how willing are they to persist with the same modes after stabilization. In this study we build and empirically test a conceptual model to study the factors influencing the willingness of Indians to persist with their post demonetization payment mode choices. The results from a survey of 138 respondents across India indicate a preference for continuing with digital payments over cash and card(s) post demonetization. Our logistic regression-based analysis suggests that privacy concerns are perhaps the strongest reason for people not to persist with digital payments; that transaction prices do not play the expected damping role in the adoption of digital payments; and that an exposure to digital payment modes has a positive and significant impact on persistence, as compared to cash or cards. This study—among the earliest of its kind trying to understand the preference of Indians with respect to payment modes post demonetization—has important practical implications for researchers, practitioners and policy makers working on issues related to the rapidly growing digital payments ecosystem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Previous studies have postulated that an advance payment system (APS) positively impacts the contractor's working capital and is paramount to ensuring an efficient and effective project cash flow process. However, scant research has been undertaken to empirically establish the cash flow performance and domino effect of APS on project and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: The epistemological design adopted a positivist philosophical stance augmented by deductive reasoning to explore the phenomena under investigation. Primary quantitative data were collected from 504 Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) registered contractors (within the grade bandings 1–9) in South Africa. A five-point Likert scale was utilised, and subsequent data accrued were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Emergent findings reveal that the mandatory use of an APS does not guarantee a positive project cash flow, an improvement in organisational performance or an improvement in project performance. Practical implications: The ensuing discussion reveals the contributory influence of APS on positive cash flow and organisational performance, although APS implementation alone will not achieve these objectives. Practically, the research accentuates the need for various measures to be concurrently adopted (including APS) towards ensuring a positive project cash flow and improved organisational and project performance. Originality/value: There is limited empirical research on cash flow performance and the domino effect of APS on project and organisational performance in South Africa, nor indeed, the wider geographical location of Africa as a continent. This study addresses this gap in the prevailing body of knowledge. © 2023, Emmanuel Dele Omopariola, Abimbola Olukemi Windapo, David John Edwards, Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa, Sunday Ukwe-Nya Yakubu and Onimisi Obari.},

Water ATMs are automatic dispensers that provide purified, drinkable liquid water at the customer’s request with minimal or no human interaction. It’s critical to enhance the quantity of potable water with the least amount of effort, expense, time, and technology. Three different types of water ATM systems are now present worldwide. These are coin and/or note-based ATMs, smart card-operated, and smart card and IoT-based systems. Smart card-based operating systems are those which can use smart cards and/or cash methods, but they are self-monitored systems. A smart card and IOT-based system Modules are integerated into the water dispenser machine to achieve an efficient payment method approach and real-time monitoring, respectively. Most ATMs are developed from components like microcontrollers, NFC and RFID smart cards, coin modules, LCD displays, solenoids, pumps, and water tankers. The socioeconomic benefits with respect to accessibility of quality water and possible technological advancements together with the cost of services are detailed to show the importance of the ATMs as the best alternative to the existing pure water supply methods. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Beneficiaries utilized the funds for cash withdrawals and food purchases at bank agents. Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed in the analysis. The government decided to use debit card with multiple wallet features. A new regulation was made to support the implementation in 2017, and by the end of 2019, the government provided more than 12 million new savings accounts to the poor. Potential future improvements are proposed for the sustainability of the solution, which include a disbursement providers' revenue model, broader financial services involvement, bank agents' inventory system, and optimizing the latest innovations. © Practical Action Publishing, 2020},

	abstract = {In Oman, cash has traditionally been the most common form of payment. Making the switch from cash to digital payments has the potential to support and promote technological advancements and advanced electronic goods and services in numerous industries. Unbanked people can use digital payment networks to enter the world of digital finance. The Central Bank of Oman has granted licensing requests to two businesses to offer electronic payment services nationwide. The Omani e-commerce sector recorded strong growth throughout the pandemic and is anticipated to grow further due to the nation's digital transformation, the introduction of 5G telecom services, the quick adoption of digital payment methods, and the growth of vibrant online marketplaces. This article examines the current state of knowledge in the digital payments sector, particularly emphasizing the Omani economy. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate how digital payment businesses may assist Oman's objectives for digitalization. By expanding the information and communications technology industry as an enabler for other economic sectors, Oman has achieved significant progress in creating the groundwork for a successful digital economy. Furthermore, the residents are on the verge of a dramatic transition that will usher in an era of cashless economies, with emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Analytics facilitating payment options. Our analysis concludes that Oman has correctly recognized and encouraged electronic payments technology, and an additional intensive strategy would be advantageous. The study's results will benefit the sector in recognizing the significance of digital payment services, particularly in Oman, to accomplish the objective of a digital economy. © 2023 IEEE.},

Socio-economic characteristics, including education, age, income, and transaction objectives or functionality have a significant effect on the probability of using non-cash electronic payment instruments. We find a substitution pattern between payment instruments, not only between cash and non-cash instruments but also between non-cash instruments.

Thus, this paper aims to explore the drivers and inhibitors of MP usage in relation to cash and card payment, which is still an underresearched area in MP. For this, we conducted an online survey (n = 227) in Germany and ran a partial least squares path modelling approach. The results reveal that relative advantage and compatibility drive the intention to use MP compared to cash and card payment. Especially, the result for relative advantage indicates that MP needs some “good” arguments to convince card-preferring users to switch to MP. Interestingly, users regard the disadvantages of MP differently. For instance, perceived switching costs are significantly stronger for MP compared to cash payment but data threat is significantly stronger for MP compared to card payment. The results of the disadvantages of MP confirm Germans’ strong “love” for cash payment and that German consumers regard MP as more similar to the card than to cash payment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The Indian payments landscape has undergone a makeover in the recent past with the decision to demonetise leading to a shortage of physical currency. The current COVID-19 pandemic created a contamination fear while exchanging and using currency. Hence, the customers started adopting digital payments. Research was conducted in this context to investigate the behaviour intentions of the customers regarding digital payment usage through application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of the Technology-2 (UTAUT2) model. This paper explores the behaviour intentions of using digital payments during the pandemic. A survey questionnaire was designed to collect the required information from 271 respondents through the judgemental sampling technique. The data were analysed using SPSS and AMOS. The results revealed that, among the seven constructs examined, effort expectancy and habit had a positive effect on behaviour intentions. No association was elicited between social influence, facilitating condition and price value on behaviour intentions. The findings also uncovered a moderately significant negative relationship between performance expectancy and hedonic motivation on behaviour intentions. Compared to prior studies, the findings regarding a few constructs from our study were in line with earlier work, whilst others were found to be not so. Also, the timing of the study might have played a role in influencing the results as most of the customers felt it was convenient to use digital payments compared to physical currency during the pandemic © All rights reserved 2021 Transnational Press London},

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a panel dataset for a selection of European Union countries from 2003 to 2016. The relation between credit card use and social and cultural attitudes is constructed by controlling for past habits in payment behavior and cross-substitution with alternative payment instruments by employing a dynamic panel data analysis based on the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. Findings: The total value of credit card payments positively correlated with values emphasizing risk-taking attitudes. When analyzing the propensity of using these instruments for larger purchases, the level of trust is the most relevant predictor. However, the results seemed region-specific with some variables correlating consumption behavior with credit card usage depending on the political and the economic background of the country. Moreover, risk-taking attitudes prevail when they are related to the extent to which countries rely on cash as a preferred payment instrument. Also, credit card usage is mainly explained by past habits and the economic context. Originality/value: The model expands on previous credit card transaction research by including an additional set of cultural values able to account for the complex nature of payment instruments and their effects on indebtedness and consumption behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The simultaneous increase in digital payments and currency in circulation might appear paradoxical, which warrants an analysis of the various motives for holding cash. Using descriptive analysis and empirical insights, this paper finds that the sustained growth in currency demand is influenced by the precautionary and store-of-value motives, while the use of cash as a payment medium continues to fall. This is indicative of the growing substitution of cash by digital payments for transactional purposes. Although income remains the dominant driver of currency demand in India, the rapid growth momentum in digital payments, combined with its statistically significant inverse association with cash, has the potential to moderate the positive income effect. © 2022, Reserve Bank of India.

Both money laundering and COVID-19 are global phenomena, so isolated state initiatives are doomed to failure. As in COVID- 19 it is preferable to avoid contagion, so it is also better to prevent money laundering than to punish it. COVID-19 has increased cybercrime, especially frauds of medical products needed to combat it or other online frauds. Most of the profits from these crimes are laundered. Also increased with COVID-19 job offers to potential money launderers through emails. In addition, Directive 2018/1673 obliges member states to ensure that new risks of virtual currencies are addressed appropriately. Directives 2015/849 and 2018/843 require continuous adaptations of the legal framework to respond to threats of the use of new technologies in money laundering. Undoubtedly, the new payment systems facilitate money launderers' criminal activity, but with COVID-19 the use of cash is avoided and electronic means of payment are preferred. In the same sense, it is even intended to eliminate cash to prevent money laundering. COVID-19 has also affected the total control of the population through mobile phones, a total control that is also intended to be used in money laundering investigations. However, total control can lead us to the world of Orwellian telescreens. © Revista de Educacion y Derecho.},

However, its advantages do not entirely dispel the doubts it still generates.

	abstract = {The article focuses on ways to assess the origin and development of the first national currency in the world which was introduced into circulation in Venezuela in 2018. Besides, it sets the goal to find out specific features of Petro (PTR) and its operation as Venezuelan national cryptocurrency. The methodological basis consists of general scientific methods of cognition to include analysis, synthesis, and comparison. The special methods such as content analysis of official documents as well as economic analysis are also applied in the article. The research produced some key findings: recent surveys confirm its new function of becoming a convenient means of payment in the environment of the cash absence, and a means of survival for many families living in the environment of a deepening economic crisis and sanctions introduce by the USA. The main outcomes imply that the national cryptocurrency PRT has some advantages over other cryptocurrencies, one of them being the fact that unlike Bitcoin and other currencies it is issued by the Venezuelan government and has a state guarantee of reliability and stability when operating in the country. However, it is not without disadvantages, the main one being the possibility of its anonymous usage which has resulted in an increased flow of illegal transactions and a larger shadow economy which has grown significantly in Venezuela. The main conclusions drawn from the research are that the introduction of the national cryptocurrency had produced a positive impact on the economic development of the country. In fact, it resulted in an increase in the number of financial transactions within the country; it led to additional opportunities concerning exchanges with other countries and international financing of Venezuela by third parties; the cryptocurrency contributed to the integration of Venezuela into a new type of the world market. © 2020, Institute of Latin American Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences.},

Mobile e-commerce applications can buy anything from anywhere at any time. It enables users to shop online anytime, anywhere. This is achieved by using smartphones as payment systems rather than credit cards or cash. The main advantage of this technology is that it can be implemented on all types of devices, such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc., which means that there are no restrictions on where people can use mobile phones to shop. The arrival of 5g era has introduced new vitality to the growth of China's mobile e-commerce, but at the same time, it has not improved the existing Internet security problems, especially the large-scale coverage of wireless WiFi, which leads to the leakage and illegal use of personal information. Its scientific and technological innovation and service diversification will make the majority of users face more serious hidden dangers of Internet and personal information security.

	abstract = {This paper assesses international remittance services in Lesotho. It finds that only a small portion of inward remittances are processed via formal remittance services, with the bulk going through informal channels, which are unsafe and inefficient. Existing commercial bank channels are rarely used, and international money transfer operators have a limited presence in Lesotho. Innovative channels, such as the mobile money services and Shoprite cash-to-cash services, have the potential to substantially formalise inward remittances and encourage the move towards digital payments and broader financial inclusion. However, the market faces numerous challenges, including: a high preference for cash; the limited number of access points and agent networks outside of urban areas; and inefficient interopera-bility between the commercial banks and mobile network operators, as well as between mobile network operators themselves. This paper argues that the authorities in Lesotho should enhance the payment systems infrastructure, harmonise the legal and regulatory framework, enhance financial literacy and encourage remittance service providers to be more active in the remittance market. In addition, the authorities should clarify the consumer protection and dispute resolution framework for remittance services as well as other financial services. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

Recent studies in UK reveal substantial rise of 27% cases of late-payments; with over £30 billion of unpaid invoices to construction contractors. Yet, there is little empirical study concerning the role of emerging digital technologies such as Agresso Unit 4, 5D-BIM and Automated Payment Systems (APS) in alleviating chronic late-payment quandary in the construction industry. What are the potentiality (likely quality that can be developed) via use of emerging technologies to minimise late-payment in the construction industry? The study adopts a sequential explanatory type of mixed methods design strategies; in addition to use of five case studies to investigate potentiality of emerging technologies in minimising late-payments. Representative population sample that includes digital technology experts and construction professionals in the UK participated in the study; for better understanding of the research problem. The findings show that implementation of emerging technologies at the right level has potential to significantly minimise late payments menace in the construction industry. In specific terms, emerging technologies have potentials to leverage deep rooted administrative payment glitches, cultural and technical problems associated late-payment problems in construction. Other findings are presented in the conclusion section of the study.

	abstract = {The current conditions of the world economy functioning in a digital format actualize approaches to understanding the characteristics of globalization and integration processes in such and are becoming increasingly important, because the world is changing rapidly in the third millennium. The introduction of a single national currency within the system of relations between the member states of the Union has raised the issue of creating payment systems with new features for settlements between central and commercial banks at the European level. The implementation of this approach required the development of theoretical aspects of globalization and integration processes in the context of digitalization of the economy and the study of their impact on the development of European and national, including Ukrainian payment sys: tems. The aim of the article is to study the trends and analyze the state of payment systems in Ukraine at the stage of further development of the economy, taking into account aspects of its digital transformation, specifying the tasks and prospects of European integration as a key benchmark. The article examines the operation of the EURO1 payment system, which is a development of the European Banking Association, and substantiates the feasibility of its use in terms of the purpose for transferring large payments, transfers in euros between banks that are registered or branches in the European Union. It is confirmed that the consideration of such specific characteristics will ensure the effective implementation of the functions of such a payment system. The results of statistical analysis of changes in the dynamics of the initial parameters of the EURO1 payment system from the moment of its foundation to the present day are presented. At the stage of consideration of theoretical and practical aspects of globalization and integration processes, their influence on the development of payment systems was revealed. A comparative analysis of the functioning of the payment space in the European Union and Ukraine was carried out, which established that the system of payments and settlements of the euro area has the characteristics of a more modern and open. As a result, the expediency of further development of the theoretical provisions on understanding the essence of the concept of "payment system", as well as improving the forms of interbank settlements and increasing the efficiency of the payment system of Ukraine on the principles of organization and functioning of European payment systems through the introduction of appropriate regulations and standards in the payment sphere of the country by the regulator is proved. © 2022, Fintech Aliance LLC.

Pen and paper has been replaced by automation that will make life much easier for all. Radio Frequency Identification or RFID is a type of wireless technology that utilizes radio waves in order to transmit data. RFID systems include three parts which are RFID tags, RFID reader, and an antenna. The RFID reader and antenna combination sends out radio frequency energy in order to power up the chip in the RFID card for it to be able to transfer data. When this type of system is applied in payment transactions like in a cafeteria or canteen, it will help eliminate long queues and record inventory and sales within a short amount of time. This paper covers the opinions and views of the customers and concessionaires regarding the alternative approach to the current payment system of using cash in transactions into a cashless transaction system using RFID technology. The researchers used survey questionnaires that made use of the Likert Scale in order to gather data and analyze the results. The paper shows comparison between the current and proposed processes and highlights the process which can be eliminated in order to improve the current payment system. Furthermore, the study includes a prototype design of the payment system with RFID technology. © IEOM Society International.},

The Augmented Dickey–Fuller unit root test and the Phillips–Perron unit root test are utilized to confirm that the variables are stationary. In the bounds test of the NARDL as well as Johansen–Juselius cointegration test, this study finds evidence of cointegration amongst variable used in the study. NARDL testing model is employed to investigate the dissimilar influences on variables with short- and long-run dynamics. Short-term estimates suggest that the money supply (M1) is most responsive to positive shocks involving retail payments, the exchange rate and interest rates, but negative shocks involving card payment and prepaid payment instruments. A reduction in card payment, as well as a positive increase in retail payment, the prepaid payment instrument, the exchange rate and the interest rate, would all have major effects on M3 in short run. In addition, a long-term finding demonstrates that all of the variables have a significant influence on the money supply (M1) in its mixed form while all of the factors, with the exception of the one involving card payments, have a considerable impact on the money supply (M3). Wald test results confirm the existence of asymmetric influences which can have significant lessons for policymakers. © 2023 Association of Asia Scholars.},

	abstract = {Construction industry professionals suffer regularly from poor cash-flow which reflects non-payment or payment delays down the hierarchical chain. This issue is important as the construction industry has the highest rates of insolvency in Australia, the UK and many other countries. Payment conditions under current construction contracts have proven to be inefficient in delivering timely payments as human interference has control over processing claims. This paper investigated the status of contracts and contract law in Australia and the potential of smart contract technology in improving payment issues in the industry. Qualitative data was collected from secondary literature sources which included observations from industry professionals, real case studies, secondary research and government surveys. It was found that smart contracts feature self-executing digital contracts, immutable data, require no intermediaries and provide transparency on all levels. Although these features are fit for purpose in resolving current contractual issues, smart contracts are not yet available in the construction industry. It was also found that smart contracts do have the potential to provide a trusted and reliable payment system in the construction industry, although there are some aspects it is unlikely to replace such as human performance. Research limitations and future research directions are also provided. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Even though cashless payment instruments are proliferating and there is talk of the expected demise of cash, the latter is still widely used, and not only in Poland. The sharp rise in cash in circulation, especially over the last few years, makes it interesting to take a closer look at its most important characteristic -The denomination structure. In this study we analyse this structure with the use of the D-Metric model in the context of NBP's recent decision to introduce the new 500 zloty banknote. A comparative analysis is also performed of the structure of the domestic currency with the structures observed in other countries. We show that the denomination structure of the Polish currency has been almost suitable to the prevailing economic conditions since 2015. The exception is 1 and 2 grosz coins, which -According to our results - should be demonetized. The decision about the introduction of the new higher denomination note seems to be an element of adjusting the denomination structure to the conditions in Poland.},

	abstract = {Mobile payments are poised to become the predominant method of transaction as we progress towards a society with reduced reliance on cash. Despite the rapid growth of mobile payments, not everyone is willing to accept them due to their perception of a lack of security and confidence (Aboobucker & Bao, 2018). This study aims to examine the factors influencing the acceptance of mobile payment among working-age individuals in Malaysia. Data was collected through questionnaires, generating a 49 percent response rate. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the data. Based on the underpinning of the technology acceptance model (TAM) the study discovers that perceived ease of use, personal innovativeness, and behavioral intention have a significant positive relationship with working-age acceptance of mobile payment. In contrast, perceived risk and social influence demonstrated an insignificant effect on working-age acceptance of mobile payment. Understanding these factors may enable service providers to allocate resources effectively and create a sustainable mobile payment ecosystem in the country (Moghavvemi et al., 2021). The study further holds significance for both managers and policymakers in their efforts to harness the potential of mobile payment services, in line with Bank Negara’s objective in transitioning towards a cashless society. © 2024 The Authors.},

From a detailed contextualization and exemplification of the historical changes that have led us to the present moment. In this article we try to the reform of the CP of December 22, 2022, focusing on art. 249.1 b) and 249.2 b), which penalizes the fraudulent use of means of payment other than metallic cash, and which is based on Directive 2019/713, of April 17, of the European Parliament and of the Council, on the fight against fraud and falsification of means of payment other than cash, which replaced Framework Decision 2001/413 JHA, of the Council. The aforementioned and necessary reform of the crime of fraud of art. 249 CP, which we understand to be the result of obsolescence caused by the fast and unstoppable technological advances of recent times, incorporates a series of indeterminate or open means of payment “...any other tangible or immaterial payment instrument other than cash or the data on hand in any of them”, which open up some uncertainty in relation to legal certainty and its real effectiveness in the fight against crime, and therefore for the service to the citizenry, and above all, for those most vulnerable groups. This requires a reflection that is based on jurisprudence and the most authoritative scientific doctrine to carry out a critical exegesis of the type and offer concrete proposals that we propose here. © Universidad de Deusto.},

Due to a deferred payment system, the costs of gross and net settlement are sensitive to the nominal interest rate. Gross settlement may dampen a consumption loss against interest-rate risk arising from inflation by acquiring additional cash from a financial market. Hence, it is optimal for the government to influence inflation and to drive net settlement out of a payment system. For payment policy, the optimal collateral requirement ratio is one whereas for monetary policy the optimal money growth rate is infinity.

This approach is considered from the perspective of the transfor-mations favored by ICT in the payment system, which incorporates increasingly more and more cashless instruments. The methodology used is based on coin-tegration analysis and error correction models. Likewise, a new indicator of some trends in the implementation of cashless transactions in payment systems is pro-posed; this measure has been applied to Spain and other European countries. With respect to long-run relationships, we demonstrate the relevant (and direct) impact of changes in the monetary system and national income on the value of cashless transactions. Regarding the short-run, the most important relationships in terms of the value of cashless transactions are those related to the real estate sector. The empirical results evidence the intensive progress of the cashless society in Spain, where the banking sector, regulatory changes and ICT development have played a key role. © 2023, Savez Ekonomista Vojvodine.

Because nowadays many unauthorized transactions are taking place due to this, anyone can drain the money in your account. Many banks are also trying to keep the security at a higher level. To accomplish a higher security, this research work uses a fingerprint technology, which can be different for every citizen. Finger print device is more flexible to use, and it is a low-cost device and reliable. By this device, a user can have a chance not to carry any cards or cash for any payments. Many are frustrated by remembering many passwords. The proposed research work can eradicate the problem with this device. Using this technology, the number of fraud transactions can be reduced. The user can get an alert whenever a transaction has been done whether it is successful or not. If any person enters the wrong password for more than three times, the image of the particular person who is performing the particular transaction will be captured and an email consisting of that captured photo will be sent to the registered mail. This device also consists of the speaker, which will be intimate on the successful completion of the transaction. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine plastic and virtual purchasing card use by US Government agencies, with particular focus on how successful implementation might inform governmental entities of potential improvements in the cost, quality and time associated with the digitization of their procure-to-pay processes. Specifically, the paper will: analyze the evolution of card-based payments by US Government agencies, compare the value stream of plastic and virtual cards to governmental entities, analyze the value of card use as a significant and sustainable contributor to greater governmental efficiency and examine the opportunity in the portability of successful card technology implementation strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined data published by the US federal government relating to agency budgets and commercial card use and combining it with industry performance metrics, projected potential savings and efficiencies for the government and its agencies. Findings: The US Government acknowledges significant administrative cost savings and cash rebates based on its spending on commercial cards. An analysis of US Government spending indicates that changing patterns of card spending are primarily driven by activities of one agency – the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Through the incorporation of advances in card technology, escalation of transaction amounts and leveraging card spending data transparency, the VA has continued to increase its use of and benefit from card technology, while other agencies have languished. By replication of VA strategy, the US Government at large has the potential for billions in card-related savings. Research limitations/implications: The study implies that a large swathe of governmental agencies, after having adopted new technology (e.g. purchasing cards), are hesitant to use the new technology, a problem that afflicts most implementation efforts. Countermeasures to offset agency resistance to change should be considered and deployed. Practical implications: Taxpayers demand much of government. The burden of governmental failure to exploit the benefits of innovation (such as card technology) falls on the shoulders of taxpayers. When the government cannot exploit technologies that are commonly used in the private sector, the failure lowers citizen respect for the capability of government employees and the ability of government writ large to solve problems. Social implications: Governmental failure to exploit the benefits of technology dispirits the citizenry, yielding a desire for change that may be disproportionate to the problem at hand. Originality/value: The study combines General Services Administration, US Treasury and market data points to make a unique assessment of the benefits derived through 20 years of governmental commercial card use. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The treasury centralized payment system developed under the treasury centralized payment system can minimize manual operation and improve work efficiency and management level. However, in actual operation, commercial banks are frequently troubled by various financial fund use security problems caused by teller operational risks. Almost all businesses handled by tellers hide potential operational risks, especially when making payment transactions at the bank counter, if the business cannot be handled correctly, it will reveal the privacy of customers and improve the risk of fund use. Then affect the normal development of commercial banks. In this context, this paper will take the Treasury Centralized Payment counter cash withdrawal and payment business as the research object, and design a treasury centralized payment counter cash withdrawal system based on blockchain technology. Taking advantage of the inherent decentralization, distributed authentication, transparent transmission and other characteristics of blockchain technology, the system not only realizes that transactions and transaction records cannot be tampered with, improves the security of payment, but also fully protects the privacy of customers. and solves the problems of fund use security and risks caused by improper teller operation under the traditional counter cash withdrawal system. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

	abstract = {Age is an important sociodemographic variable in theoretical models representing individuals’ adoption of mobile technology, such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The vast majority of TAM and UTAUT models that have been verified in empirical studies confirm the statistically significant influence of age on the acceptance of mobile technology in banking services (e.g. Laforet, Li 2005; Laukkanen et al. 2007; Cruz et al. 2010; Koksal 2016; Laukkanen 2016; Tam, Oliveira 2016; Liébana-Cabanillas, Muñoz-Leiva, Sánchez-Fernández 2018; Owusu Kwateng, Osei Atiemo, Appiah 2019). In the analysis of consumer behaviour on the mobile banking market, age can also be quantified in the form of belonging to a generational cohort. The members of various cohorts have different experiences in the use of digital technology (Parensky 2001) and differ in their attitudes towards mobile technology in banking services and in their preferences for the channel of access to these services (e.g. Ruangkanjanases, Wongprasopchai 2018; Waliszewski, Warchlewska 2021). Therefore, the purpose of the article was to identify similarities and differences in the use of BLIK functionality among users of mobile banking applications from generations X, Y and Z. BLIK is a unique Polish mobile payment system that works with a bank’s mobile application. Its users can use the following options (functionalities): Internet payment (so-called instant transfer), point-of-sale payment with code and contactless ATM cash withdrawal, P2P payment, and BLIK check generation. A hypothesis was formulated that there are significant differences in the use of selected BLIK functionalities between users of banking applications from different generations. The hypothesis was verified based on the results of a quantitative survey (CAWI) conducted in January 2022 on a sample of 1180 users of banks’ mobile applications aged 18–56. The analysis of the influence of belonging to a generational cohort on the frequency of use of BLIK functionalities was carried out in two steps. In the first, Pearson’s chi-square independence test was conducted and BLIK functionalities were identified, the use of which shows a statistically significant relationship with belonging to a generational cohort. In the second step, a correspondence analysis was used to identify differences in the structure of associations between use of specific BLIK functionalities and belonging to generations X, Y and Z. The analyses confirmed that there are significant differences in the frequency of use of the following BLIK functionalities between individuals from generations X, Y and Z: Internet transfer, P2P payment (money transfer to phone) and payment at POS with code entry. Online transfer is most often used by Generation Y individuals, while P2P transfer and payment at a POS with a code is the domain of Generation Z. In evaluating BLIK’s perspectives, a number of other factors should be taken into account in addition to age (or belonging to a generational cohort). Among others, Błach and Klimontowicz (2021) point to the speed and security of BLIK use, the offering of unique functionalities (e.g. P2P payments), the digitization of financial services, the popularization of consumer access to mobile devices, and the increasing demand for mobile payments as a result of the development of e-commerce and m-commerce. © 2023 Narodowy Bank Polski.

	abstract = {In recent years, the rise in digital payments has spurred discussion about the future of cash at the point of sale. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to this discussion. To better under¬stand cash acceptance and the impact of payment innovations such as mobile payments in Canada, the Bank of Canada conducted the 2021–22 Merchant Acceptance Survey Pilot Study — a survey of around 500 small and medium-sized businesses. We find that 97 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses in Canada accepted cash in 2021–22 and only 3 per cent have plans to stop accepting cash. For cards and digital pay¬ments, merchant acceptance has increased over the last few years. Therefore, cash and digital pay¬ments continue to co-exist at the point of sale, and Canada is far from being a cashless society. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

Some commercial platforms accumulated large transaction date from users’ smartphones. In the repeat consumption activities, the final few (or recency) consumption has a great impact on current consumption than long-ago consumption. But traditional HMM can’t deal with this recency effect in our repeat consumption case. This paper proposes a modified HMM method based on recency effect to predict the users’ repeat consumption behavior. We introduce a factor to represent the different recency effect of different time distance. An empirical study on real-world data sets shows encouraging results on our approach, especially on the consumer group which has the most uncertain consumption behavior. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

As this paper will argue, ensuring the adoption of CBDCs in Asia-Pacific requires a ‘future-proof’ solution that is sufficiently flexible to adapt to advances in payments technology.

The development of digitalization has made people accustomed to doing digital transactions by keeping physical money in bank accounts and digital wallets. This, makes banking institutions and non-bank institutions race for payment systems, debit cards, digital wallets, and digital money. Cash usage is declining significantly and can pose challenges in managing payment systems and policies. The central bank is difficult to monitor because the data is stored separately and not in one system. Then came the emergence of virtual currencies, which have a high risk because there is no official administrator overseeing them. It affects the stability of the financial system and is detrimental to society. The Central Bank is planning to introduce a new digital currency system called the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). CBDC is a digital coin used to facilitate digital payments and reduce the risk of using unofficial virtual money. The research focuses on the design of a CBDC retail model that is used by the public to conduct transactions that leverage blockchain technology with the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The research proposes a business model and architecture for the blockchain network. The implementation of CBDC retail with Hyperledge Fabric responds to the challenges of the era of digitalization, which has a high level of privacy and data security. The central bank can monitor money flows and have direct access to the CBDC payment system. © 2023 IEEE.},

The general idea is to design low-cost electronics for cash handling systems. We establish a prototypical demonstrator which allows a consistent image capture quality and is able to handle complex algorithms for banknote authentication on cost-effective hardware. Therefore, tasks regarding reducing the evaluation time, without diminishing the reliability of the algorithms have to be considered. In this contribution we focus on the re-design of an authentication module for detection of commercial offset printing. This module analyses images in view to periodic printing patterns by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We propose to implement two concepts: an adaptive software architecture for DFT and parallel image processing. The re-design reduces evaluation time, without compromising the reliability of the authentication algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.},

Potato trading in highland vegetable production centers in Central Java province has been analyzed using Structure, Conduct, and Performance (SCP) techniques. The data was collected through a survey and observation. The market structure was analyzed by market share, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the Concentration Ratio for Biggest Four (CR4). Analysis of market behavior includes the presence or absence of collusive practices in determining prices, the process of selling and buying, the formation of equilibrium prices, payment systems (cash, credit), and cooperation with other trading institutions. While market performance is analyzed by marketing margins and farmer's share. The samples of potato farmers were determined by the random sampling method and the traders determined by the snowball sampling method. The number of samples used was 82 potato farmers, 45 collecting traders, 10 wholesaling traders, and 14 retailing traders. The results of market structure research on potato trading are oligopsonies. Price behavior at farmers (producer) level is more controlled by collectors who deal directly with farmers. Wholesalers dominate purchases from collectors, the payments are made in cash or paid later. Moreover, the collusive practice between collectors and wholesalers occurs, especially in the provision of capital or credit. Furthermore, the performance of the potato market based on the trading system margin is greatest in pattern 2, while the farmer's share is greatest in pattern 1 in the potato trading system. © 2020 Sciedu Press.},

In both public and private sector computer applications, blockchain (a popular cryptocurrency technology) promises to be hugely disruptive and liberating. Blockchain provides a consensus record with an encrypted audit trail that can be maintained and validated by different nodes as a mechanism to rank transactions in a distributed ledger. The use of blockchain and bitcoin as an alternative payment system has been unquestionably broad, not just in e-commerce but also in other areas of finance. Major businesses who adopted cryptocurrency have benefited from the boom, but there is a risk of value depreciation because cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile. While bitcoin enables for anonymous purchases via encrypted wallet addresses, it's essentially the same as carrying about unmarked cash. This allows your customers to purchase things without exposing their personal information, and it allows you to conduct business without fear of violating any privacy laws.

As a result, the use of state-issued money as legal tender continues to decline in most countries. In turn, the functions and existence of legal tender has decreased. Acknowledging such facts, the purpose of this research is to examine an ideal legal tender for the digital era that can restore the legal tender function while accommodating payment innovation. This research explores legal theories on money and legal tender, as well as the characteristics of various forms of money issued by the State and the private sector, i.e., fiat money, commercial bank money, cryptocurrency, and central bank digital currency. This research concludes that an ideal legal tender for the digital era should incorporate both cash and digital currency. Under this notion, central bank digital currency might serve as the ideal legal tender for the digital era. Nonetheless, there are certain prerequisites to the issuance of such legal tender. These include at least conducting thorough interdisciplinary research and pilot projects by the central bank, establishing an adequate regulatory framework, and ensuring public acceptance of such currency as a means of payment, as well as developing the necessary infrastructure. © 2023, Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {Banks are special in that their liabilities are widely accepted as a means of payment, thereby often needed by real sectors to obtain resources. This paper studies this interaction between the banking sector and real sectors on competitive markets and the policy response of the central bank to market inefficiency, which is determined by the aggregate wealth of banks. In the circumstance of a credit crunch, the central bank improves efficiency by allowing banks to borrow its fiat money at zero interest up to a limit. This policy bears the flavor of quantitative easing policies (QE). It produces real effects in the absence of surprises and nominal rigidity. The mechanism in which it works depends on a difference in nature between bank-created money and fiat money. Furthermore, this policy, while expanding the money supply, induces deflation under the positive productivity shock. Lastly, this paper explains when interest rate policy and capital adequacy regulation are among the optimal policies within a unified model. © 2019, European Central Bank. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pledges to realize a vast array of new functionalities, such as frictionless consumer payment and money-transfer systems, as well as precise supervision of money circulation, thereby enabling a number of new financial instruments and monetary policy levers. This study proposes, from a system feedback loop and cybernetics perspective, a Dynamic Issuance Mechanism (DIM) for CBDC that can theoretically enhance the vitality of economic operations. In accordance with this mechanism, the central bank implements dynamic issuance by monitoring cash leakage in real-time, so as to maintain the stability of the amount of money circulating on the market, thereby boosting the currency turnover rate and financial vitality. To demonstrate the efficacy of the DIM, we employ the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) tool to develop a macroeconomic simulation model for qualitative analysis that includes four entities: Central Bank, households, firms, and commercial banks. The multi-cycle operation process of the model includes a variety of economic indicators demonstrating that DIM has the potential to boost economic vitality and social production efficiency without exerting an adverse effect on citizens' incomes, commodity prices, or the stability of the macroeconomic system. Finally, the function principle and potential risks of DIM are explained from a systems perspective, which offers a novel perspective for the functional design of CBDC and highlights that the hierarchical structure is a meaningful domain as the developmental direction.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

Study level/applicability: MBA. Case overview: Musoni Kenya is a Kenyan microfinance institution (MFI) whose idea was conceived in The Netherlands. The Musoni business model is ICT-enabled, 100 percent mobile based, virtually paperless, and runs on an ICT platform housed in Musoni BV in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It is built on tested mobile technology that allows huge savings on transaction and operating costs. Using mobile payments, clients receive and perform bank operations anytime anywhere. This saves transport costs, transaction time and increases safety as no cash has to be carried around sometimes in dangerous areas. The mobile payments enable clients to make large improvements in loan officer efficiency and makes tracing payments seamless, saving on administration costs. The Musoni branches are also inexpensive as they are only used as the point of contact with customers hence reducing the cost of setting up operations even in remote areas. These efficiencies are passed on to clients in the form of lower interest rates and to stakeholders in the form of good returns on investments. The company aims to use this knowledge, experience and global ICT platform to expand to other countries with a suitable mobile payments environment. Expected learning outcomes: The objective of this case is to illustrate general innovation concepts in a leading microfinance company in Kenya. The case documents the innovation dilemma facing the management of the fledgling microfinance company in determining the pace of innovation and the feasibility of launching of a similar service in Uganda following the successful establishment and growth of the company in Kenya.

Push factors comprise risk and service-related factors, pull factors consist of subjective and aspect-based factors and mooring factors include cost and cognitive factors. Design/methodology/approach: Sample of the study consists of around 296 undergraduate and postgraduate students from different higher educational institutions located in India. The questionnaire for data collection comprises 21 Likert scale-based items distributed among seven constructs. Partial least square structural equation modeling is used to identify the significant factors influencing students’ intentions. Findings: Five of the factors, namely, risk, service, subjective, aspect and cognitive significantly influence student’s intention to switch to mobile payment system for academic fee payments. Moderation analysis indicates that the impact of the push and pull factors on switching intention towards mobile payments has a more positive influence among male students. Originality/value: This study is probably the only study that tested the specific push, pull and mooring factors influencing intention to switch to mobile payment from cash payment in the Indian education system based on the incentive, Fogg behavior and status quo bias theory for academic fee payment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study finds insufficient evidence supporting the claim that demonetization led to an enhanced adoption of digital channels (measured by the value of transactions as a percentage of money supply). On the other hand, the lockdown in the wake of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the adoption of some new-age payment channels. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The global monetary and financial system, as a form of organization of international monetary and financial relations, is designed to provide framework conditions for the unimpeded exchange of goods, services and capital between countries, in order to maintain sustainable economic growth. Currently, the functionality of the international currency standard is exposed to the influence of disintegration processes in the global economy and global finance, which are caused by the growth of geopolitical tensions. The purpose of the article is to identify and characterize the main institutional aspects of the fragmentation of the global monetary and financial system, taking into account their impact on the transformation of the global financial architecture. It is demonstrated that the geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China is caused by the desire to overcome their interdependence in the areas of global supply chains and the production of new-generation semiconductors, respectively. The article discusses the main trends that are currently characterizing the fragmentation of the global monetary and financial system, such as institutional dysfunctionality, the bloc confrontation between mature and emerging financial and economic centers, de-dollarization of international reserves and digitalization of international settlements. The article substantiates the influence of these trends on the transformation of the global financial architecture, which is manifested in the crisis of the institutional foundations of the global monetary and financial system and the chaotic reorganization of international monetary and financial relations under the influence of digitalization processes. The article identifies the reasons for the institutional dysfunctionality of the global monetary and financial system, including the decline in the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a lender of last resort and the loss of state control over the growth of the money supply in the global economy. It also examines the factors explaining the motivation of central banks to diversify the structure of official foreign exchange reserves. Particular attention is paid to the problem of introducing central bank digital currencies as a method of counteracting the asymmetric use of the US dollar at the international level and as a way of improving international financial stability. It is concluded that changing the position of the US dollar in the global financial architecture, as a key international liquidity, depends on the efforts of the world’s majority countries in creating a systemic alternative to the current international monetary order based on advanced financial technologies. © 2025, RUDN University.

Because of the recent pandemic (covid-19), M-payment use has grown in Saudi Arabia. People were forced to rely on online transactions or near-field communication. However, some people are hesitant to use it because they distrust technology or are afraid of fraud. Numerous factors have been put forth as potential influences on how people behave when using M-payment. Nearly all the participants in this study, which took place in Saudi Arabia, were Saudi citizens. Perceived value, convenience value, and low risk value all correlate favorably with the inclination to use M-payment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The link between the monetary worth on the other hand, is antagonistic. the social value and enjoyment value impact is neutral. © Proceedings of International Conference on Research in Education and Science 2024.},

	abstract = {The growth of digitalisation presents the possibility for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to emerge as a secure and efficient payment method. However, despite the benefits, CBDC implementation needs to be adapted to the capabilities and needs of each country. This study uses meta-strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (meta-SWOT) analysis to assess the internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external opportunities and threats, to determine the most optimal CBDC design for emerging economies. In analysing internal aspects, CBDC allows for an efficient payment system, followed by a more effective monetary policy. Furthermore, the technology creates the possibility to boost financial inclusion and trace many illicit activities. However, to achieve that, high investment costs and privacy issues must be accommodated, followed by technological risks such as the digital divide and electrical outages. Turning to external aspects, growing technology, the network effect, enthusiasm for CBDC, and the impracticality of cash usage have become catalysts for CBDC development. Despite these opportunities, central banks should be wary of the threat of cyberattacks, quickening bank disintermediation, legal issues within their respective countries, and competition with private crypto companies. Altogether, the most optimal CBDC design in emerging economies is retail and wholesale coverage, interest-bearing (wholesale) and noninterest-bearing (retail) remuneration, account-based and token-based payment systems, a traceable degree of anonymity, hybrid architecture, a Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) ledger system, and domestic and cross-border scope. These results are supported by rigorous examination of global CBDC research and development. © 2024, Bank Indonesia Institute. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Buses are the integral means of transport sources in India. In metropolitan cities, over millions of people travel through public transport every day. The major problem faced by the passengers is unnecessary waiting time at stations. Hence to overcome this, tracking of a vehicle is much necessary. Because of the accuracy and affordability, GPS technology has become one of the most popular solutions for such applications. On the other side, smart payment is trending everywhere. Smart payment can offer an easy and convenient automated bill payment system. Implementing this in transportation, would help the passengers to travel even when they don’t have enough cash with them. This project mainly deals with developing a website which will help in smart transport and smart payment system. Tracking and fetching of the location of a bus is done using the GPS system. This helps in knowing the location of vehicle, which in return helps in proper planning and managing time. The tracking of the bus is done using the GPS system, by which the passenger can come to know the location of that particular bus in which he desires to travel by entering the required information in the website. Smart payment is also done through the website developed in this project, where a passenger needs to sign in and enter the required information for the payment. This will even help in displaying the balance amount in his account. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {Background Whereas digital payments have been identified as a solution to health payment challenges, evidence on their adoptability among Community Health Workers (CHWs) is limited. Understanding their adoptability is crucial for sustainability. This study assessed the adoptability of digital payments for CHWs in Wakiso district, Uganda. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was conducted between November and December 2022, in Wakiso district, Uganda. We surveyed a random sample of 150 CHWs using a structured questionnaire and conducted key informant interviews among three purposively selected Digital payment coordinators. The study utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework to assess the adoptability of digital payments among CHWs. Factor analysis was performed to extract composite variables from the original constituting variables. Using the median, the outcome was converted to a binary variable and logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between the TAM constructs and adoptability of digital payments by CHWs. Quantitative data was analyzed using STATA 14, while qualitative data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using ATLAS.ti 22. Results Nearly all participants (98.0%; n = 49) had previously received payments through mobile money, a digital payment method. (52%; n = 78) of CHWs said they intend to use digital payment modalities. Perceived risk of digital payments was associated with 83% lower odds of adoptability of digital payment modalities (OR = 0.17;95%CI:0.052, 0.54), while perceived trust had nearly three times higher odds of adoptability of digital payment modalities (OR = 2.82;95%CI:1.41, 5.67). Qualitative interviews showed that most CHWs reported positive experiences with digital health payments, including effectiveness and completeness of payments except for delays associated with mobile money payments across payment providers. Mobile money was reported to be easy to use, in addition to fostering financial responsibility compared to cash. Conclusion CHWs in Wakiso district intend to use digital payment modalities, particularly mobile money/ e-cash. Perceived risk of the payment method and trust are key determinants of adoptability. Synergized efforts by both payment providers to manage payment delays and mitigate risks associated with digital payments could attenuate perceived risk and build trust in digital payment modalities. © 2024 Kembabazi et al.

Utilizing the nationally representative data from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey, we employ the People's Bank of China's 2010 issuance of the Administrative Measures on Non-financial Institution Payment Services as an instrumental variable to analyze Alipay adoption. Our findings indicate that Alipay significantly diminishes Chinese households' reliance on bank branches for financial services. The analysis reveals two main effects: firstly, Alipay reduces households' cash holdings and demand deposits; secondly, it shifts financial management activities from bank branches to online platforms. Additionally, our heterogeneity analysis shows that the shift from bank branches to Alipay is more pronounced among individuals with higher educational levels and those in urban areas. These insights contribute new micro-level evidence to the understanding of FinTech's impact on commercial banks. © 2025 The Authors},

New payment methods enable merchants and businesses to realise the potential economic gains from shifting to more efficient electronic payments such as improved cash flow efficiencies, reduced costs and protection from fraud. This paper examines the influences and challenges associated with the evaluation and selection of methods for paying for goods and services by online merchants, specifically within the context of traditional and alternative payment methods and the Internet environment. Using a qualitative approach, representatives from five Australian online businesses were interviewed to (1) provide a snapshot of the payments landscape from a merchant perspective and (2) identify competing and conflicting requirements of merchants and their customers with respect to the use of payment methods. In view of the sensitive nature of the subject matter, particularly with regard to the issues of fraud, security, chargebacks and transaction volumes, a case study approach was considered to be more appropriate and effective. The findings suggest that merchants need to keep abreast of and adapt to changes in the payment field while taking cognisance of the changing patterns in consumer payment behaviour and the need to engender trust and confidence in the payment process.},

The tasks, information, and services provided have become simpler and, above all, more accessible to all users. In recent years, the use of electronic payment instruments in the Republic of North Macedonia has increased. According to the latest statistical data, payments made with electronic instruments, such as debit cards and credit cards, have marked a significant increase in use, affecting the decrease in the number of cash payments. Despite the increasing availability and adoption of e-banking services, there remains a significant portion of the population that shows hesitation or resistance to using these platforms. The objectives of the study include the analysis of the current trends of e-banking, the identification of the motives and advantages of its use, the assessment of the safety and reliability of e-banking platforms by citizens, as well as the examination of the influence of socioeconomic factors, and demographics in the use of e-banking. Also, the study will investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changing payment and transaction habits and increasing the use of e-banking during the COVID-19 crisis.

Although digital payment instruments have been around for some time, beyond the analysis of some specific cases and related ethical issues, a comprehensive approach is still absent from the literature. Starting from the claim that access to a payment system is a basic human right, we lay the foundations for a framework of fundamental ethical principles we find essential in designing and operating a morally sound and resilient payment system. Two main principles will be proposed: financial inclusion and fair treatment of users. Each principle has three dimensions: financial inclusion embraces physical, intellectual and economic accessibility to the payment system, fair treatment of users means protection against illegal and/or illegitimate surveillance, trustworthiness and fair distribution of costs. Relying on these principles we discuss their significance in the payment system with special focus on the transition from a cash-dominant payment system to a fully digital one. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The current generation of young people faces significant financial challenges in an increasingly volatile global economy, highlighting the need for enhanced financial literacy education. While the OECD has recommended the integration of financial literacy into school curricula, a notable gap exists in the development of age-appropriate financial literacy content that aligns with students' cognitive and developmental stages. This study addresses this gap by evaluating students' financial literacy knowledge, with a particular focus on integrating financial concepts into mathematics education. Specifically, the research targets financial topics that are accessible and relatable to upper elementary school students, exploring how these concepts can be integrated into existing mathematics curricula. The study involved students from grades 4, 5, and 6, with data collected through interviews that were transcribed and analyzed using NVIVO software. Findings indicate that topics such as exchange rates, foreign currencies, cash transactions, and digital payment systems resonate with students' existing knowledge and personal experiences. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of introducing foundational personal financial management skills, such as distinguishing between needs and wants and promoting saving habits, from an early age. However, it also highlights that more complex financial concepts, including regulatory frameworks, consumer protection, and data security risks, are not developmentally appropriate for elementary students. The results of this research offer valuable insights into the practical integration of financial literacy into mathematics classrooms, with potential implications for curriculum development. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on financial literacy education, providing a basis for selecting relevant financial topics for school curricula and fostering a more financially literate future generation. © The Authors 2025.},

The benevolent government provides electronic payment services and allocates relevant social cost through taxation on the beneficiaries' labor and consumption. A higher tax rate on labor yields the following desirable allocations. First, it implies a lower welfare loss because of the distortionary consumption taxation. It also enhances the economy of scale in the use of electronic payment technology, reducing per transaction cost of electronic payment. Finally, it saves the cost of withdrawing and carrying around cash by reducing the frequency of cash trades. All these channels together imply optimality of the unity tax rate on labor.},

	abstract = {In Germany after World War I in years 1918-1923 inflation was a decisive negative economic factor. Since 1923 the inflation process started to increase suddenly. Since July 1923 German currency lost its function of means of payment. Cash was changed into valuables as quickly as possible. Economic development was totally crippled. In Wrocław need for flats was enormous. It was much bigger than in other German cities. In June 1919 building cooperative "Schlesische Heimstätte", provinzielle Wohnungsfü rsorgegesellschaft m.b.H (Silesian Homestead, provincial company supporting housing construction, Ltd.), was founded in Wrocław as part of Prussian housing act. It acted under the aegis of Ministry of Social Care. In the first years after WWI, at the time of great postwar crisis, Ernst May - a young architect beginning his career, was appointed as a manager of "Schlesische Heimstätte". The company was to supply people of modest means with healthy and properly furnished flats at low prices. In the first half of the twenties so called crises houses (Notheime) were proposed. The propositions of the smallest houses were introduced in 1919-1920. They were dwelling summer houses with a room, small barn and toilet. They were to be enlarged or replaced with new buildings after the economic situation would have improved. Because of the lack of building materials after WWI, building cooperatives used substitute materials. Traditional natural materials were recommended in all designs - walls built from bricks and plastered, wooden truss and roof covered with tile. In order to find cheap solutions old local building materials were used. Walls could be built from dried clay blocks, limestone, calcareous slag or wood. Shingled or even thatched roof houses were suggested. A lot of attention was paid for economically and ergonomically designed layout of crises houses. They were to solve the enormous dwelling problems in Wroclaw and Silesia. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

Through a combination of theoretical modeling and empirical analysis, including two extensive surveys among EU participants, we explore whether CBDCs can change the ELB and affect consumer preferences in favor of the digital euro over physical cash. Our findings indicate that the introduction of the DE could potentially move the ELB from its current value of around −1.30% by approximately 0.25%. If agents had the possibility to move their deposits into both cash and DE, they would convert approximately 52% of the converted amount into cash and the rest into CBDCs. However, over a 10 year period, the situation would shift in favor of the DE, with a share of 63%. Both findings show that NIRPs will be more limited in the case of the introduction of CBDCs (DE). These facts must be considered both when deciding whether to introduce a CBDC (DE) and after its eventual introduction in the case of NIRP application. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, the current practice is failing to utilise the potential of a link between project performance and clients' satisfaction on one hand and stakeholders' cash flow on the other. Therefore, a paradigm shift in cash flow research is both timely and necessary. The purpose of this paper is to promote and facilitate the use of appropriate payment systems that satisfy all project members. Design/methodology/approach The research first investigates how payment systems are being selected, and the drivers for selecting innovative payment systems. A simulation and selection IT system is then developed that can be used to facilitate project stakeholders' satisfaction by selecting the most appropriate payment system for each project member. The proposed system considers alternative payment terms and conditions across the supply chain and in a transparent and negotiated manner. Findings The outcome should result in planning cash flows that satisfy all team members. The planned cash flow profiles are then used to monitor the implementation of the agreed payment system. Originality/value The main conclusion of the paper is that appropriate payment systems can act as a performance enabler and the provision of the simulation tool would result in project teams taking a more conscious and rational decision in selecting or designing these systems. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

One of the episodes was a substantial surge in Czech currency holdings after the outbreak of the financial crisis in late 2008. Results based on a model of currency demand show that the increase in currency in circulation in the last quarter of 2008 cannot be explained by common variables, which include retail sales, interest rate, innovation in payment systems, and tourism. Separate models of currency demand for small and large denominations revealed significant differences in terms of sensitivity to different variables. While small-value banknotes are mainly driven by domestic transactions, payment system innovations and tourism, the demand for large-value banknotes depends more on a short-term interest rate. Increased currency demand had to be explicitly modeled only in case of high-denomination banknotes and was best explained by the confidence indicator.},

	abstract = {This article presents estimates of the time efficiency of a wide range of payment methods used at the Point-Of-Sale (POS) from traditional cash and standard cards to contactless cards, RFID stickers and mobile payments (NFC and remote). More than 3, 700 transactions were timed by means of digital chronography of video material recorded by cameras installed in the biggest chain of convenience stores in Poland. Our novel approach confirms that until recently cash was the fastest payment method available at POS. Traditional payment cards equipped with a magnetic stripe or EMV chip are significantly slower at the checkout. However, nowadays a technological breakthrough occurs in the evolution of means of payment. The innovative payment methods designed for low-value transactions, such as contactless cards and NFC mobile payments, are competitive to cash in terms of time efficiency. Contactless cards used in offline mode and without printing paper slips are the first popular electronic payment method in history faster than cash. Conversely, the remote mobile payments method tested has lower time efficiency at POS. Our results could be used by merchants who want to optimise their payment process and by developers of innovative payment solutions.},

It is derived from Brands’ scheme presented at Crypto’93, in the sense that the coins are built using the representation problem. The main contribution of our solution consists of the speedup of the withdrawal protocol. The gain of efficiency is achieved preserving the same level of integrity for user, shop and bank. A coin remains untraceable with respect to the user. This feature is fulfilled even if one assumes that the bank has unlimited computing power and colludes with shops in order to trace a coin to a specific user. However, a set of coins axe linkable to a pseudonym of the user, restricting in this way his privacy. This drawback can be limited by “rotating” coins derived from different pseudonyms in a set of consecutive payment transactions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

Based on this knowledge gap, this research intends to explore, analyze, and identify design concepts for mobile money information system development that can support rural communities in developing countries who transact in open air market. Majority of our study population cannot write and read even their names; they identify currency notes based on color and size not based on values written on them, which raises the question how could such illiterate rural individuals transact in electronic payment ecosystem. In this context, the purpose of this study is to thoroughly analyze and understand the characteristic nature of cash transactions and usage scenarios among study participants in open air market and identify design concepts and provoke discussions on this issue. Methodologically, we used qualitative methods, where data is collected through observation, discussions, and interview with key market participants and the data is documented through photograph and video. We found that almost all merchants: (1) use color of currencies to identify one from the other, (2) some merchants want to merge their sells while some want to keep their daily, (3) due to their transaction practices, merchants have many problems and make many errors and mistakes, (4) merchants who have no formal education expressed that they would like to have devices that operate by sound, and (5) sellers & buyers set prices of certain items through negotiation. The output of this study contributes towards the development of cashless transaction based on mobile phones. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The possibility of introducing another form of official money, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), recognised by legislation, has long been discussed worldwide. This paper aims to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of such a solution, as well as to highlight the challenges facing legislatures about the possibility of legalising digital currency and, above all, protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens participating in the process. Due to its technological nature, CBDC is characterised by a much lower level of anonymity than conventional cash, which is often presented as a disadvantage. However, an analysis of this solution seems to weigh in favour of its advantages. One of them is the possibility of using CBDCs to support the process of financial inclusion referred to in the United Nations document Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is an important subject of academic research that can be carried out under the doctrine of financial-market law. Undoubtedly, this matter also has an increasing impact on the practice of financial-market functioning and fiscal and monetary policy decisions. In particular, financial law plays a key role in solving socioeconomic problems and is becoming an instrument for achieving the goals set by the United Nations. The research subject of CBDC is innovative and exploratory, as money, no matter how it is perceived, is, has been and will continue to be an instrument to change the world for the better. © 2024 Tomasz Nieborak published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {David Chaum and Stefan Brands have proposed famous electronic cash schemes. Both schemes offer multi-party security as well as unconditional privacy of payments. We can see that Brands has managed to design a new kind of payment system without the inefficient features of Chaum's electronic cash while still matching most of the requirements placed on electronic cash. Brands' scheme uses simpler signature mechanisms, shorter messages and has smaller storage requirements, which make it very easy and feasible to implement in a wireless network. Both Chaum and Brands' electronic cash schemes are off-line electronic schemes. Unfortunately, to prevent Double-Spending from happening, the security of Brands' scheme relies heavily on the tamper-resistance device. The best way to prevent Double-Spending is to use some kind of on-line system. The on-line electronic payment system has been criticized mostly for its cost inefficiency and its inconvenience. But with the high developing speed of mobile techniques, many people like to use their mobile phone to navigate the Internet or send short messages, for example, NTT's Docomo. People nowadays like to be on-line everywhere and it is a trivial thing to require the user to be on-line when doing the electronic payment in the near future. This paper introduces an electronic payment system that implements Brands' efficient technology (restrictive blinding signature) into the user's mobile phone or user's PDA. The system is very efficient because of using restrictive blinding signature scheme and offers multi-party security as well as unconditional privacy of payments. This system has some features of on-line system, so it can prevent double-spending from happening.},

The proof consists of two stages, the first stage proves the speed of adjustment, and the second stage proves the long-term and short-term balance of the effect of non-cash payment system indicators on Indonesia's economic growth from 2010 to 2020. The analytical model used is the dynamic autoregressive lag distribution (ARDL) specification, according to Koyck's approach, and the error correction model (ECM). The results show that the speed of adjustment of the non-cash payment system with the Card-Based Payment Instrument indicator is measured by the Value of debit card transactions, the Value of credit card transactions, as well as the Value of e-money transactions in Indonesia's economic growth, rejects the proposed hypothesis because the adjustment speed is less than 1 (has a slow response). Likewise, the results of the proof of the ECM model show that there is no balance or short-term or long-term relationship between the observed variables. © 2025, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

	abstract = {In order to identify the factors influencing the establishment of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in Malaysia, this study leverages the machine-learning technique to determine the most critical factors leading to CBDC issuance in Malaysia. The overall Central Bank Digital Currency Project Index (CBDCPI) was selected as a target variable, while two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost were utilized to identify the determining variables. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide feature importance scores, which were crucial in identifying the most significant factors. The models were trained and validated using a rigorous cross-validation process to ensure robustness. The accuracy achieved through the Random Forest was 83%, and subsequently, 80% in XGBoost. This study explored a new research frontier by creating two machine-learning models that treated retail and wholesale CBDCPI as target variables. The data used in the process are gathered from various official sources such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. The Circulation of Cash, Prevalence of Cryptocurrencies, Effect of CBDC on International Trade, the Search Interest, Financial Development Index, Innovation Value, and Trade Openness are some of the most critical factors determining whether CBDC will be issued in Malaysia. Generally, are identified as important factors determining whether CBDC will be issued in Malaysia. Eventually, the factors identified will be used to develop a framework for the implementation of CBDC in Malaysia. © 2024, American Diabetes Association. All rights reserved.},

Finally, we analyse how the proposed scheme matches the identified security requirements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

In our model, household preferences are determined by the perceived attributes of these instruments, and hence their choice regarding payment methods depends on the differences in these characteristics across these instruments. The results indicate that consumer choice is sensitive to the perceived characteristics at statistically significant level. We employ the estimated model to evaluate demand for central bank digital currency (CBDC), based on its expected design and consumer perceptions of it. We discuss several illustrative projections to demonstrate the application of the tool developed. The predicted use of CBDC varies considerably, depending on the perceived characteristics, although the projected use of CBDC in household transactions is limited under conservative assumptions: the projected share of digital rubles in the total number of transactions varies from 18 percent to 35 percent. © 2024 Borsa İstanbul Anonim Şirketi},

	abstract = {Background: The way we interact with money is undergoing a sea change. Prompted by the move to more digital transactions and a significant decline in cash usage, central banks are mulling the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). However, the failure of cryptocurrencies to, despite all the hype, gain widespread adoption as a retail payment solution, poses the question whether central banks can succeed where cryptocurrencies failed. Method: We present an adoption model for digital currencies, and adapt it separately to cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDC. These models are evaluated in a large-scale user study with 785 respondents from Germany representative of the working-age population. This allows us to test whether CBDC are evaluated differently from cryptocurrencies using multigroup-analysis. Results: We find that adoption of all three currencies is similarly driven by self-efficacy and trust, while risk factors only show a negligible effect on adoption intention. Furthermore, CBDC score higher for both anteceding measures, indicating a higher willingness to adopt CBDC among the German population. Conclusion: This study offers encouraging signs for the future adoption potential of CBDC, as while the underlying adoption process could not be shown to be different, the observed level of self-efficacy and trust towards CBDC was significantly higher than for both classical cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Additionally, this paper illustrates how multigroup analysis can be employed to compare the adoption process of different technologies as long as equivalent model items can be found for each technology. © 2025 by the Association for Information Systems.},

Using both primary and secondary data, we assess the impact of e-payment integration on consumer behavior and market performance, particularly by identifying key transactional and demographic patterns. Our analysis reveals significant geographic and economic disparities in the adoption of credit card systems, with urban and higher-income areas more likely to implement such technologies. Furthermore, consumer data shows that the availability of e-payment options significantly increases spending behavior, with consumers favoring the convenience and security of credit cards over cash. Notably, we identify two distinct consumer segments—Market Mavericks and Yearly Patrons—whose payment preferences and market attendance behaviors offer insights for targeted business strategies. The Market Mavericks, who are more receptive to e-payment technologies, demonstrate increased spending and frequent engagement, highlighting the revenue potential for small businesses. Our findings suggest that adopting e-payment systems might reduce transaction costs and create opportunities for service innovation that align with evolving consumer preferences, offering a strategic pathway for business growth and market expansion. © 2025, Small Business Institute.

This qualitative research conducted between June and November 2011 compares payment types with available alternatives by their transactional motives. As informational insecurities like unauthorized access to funds and identity theft threaten current electronic systems, this could be the right moment to introduce an innovative system which could minimize insecurities, perhaps by implementing biometric payments into the banking technology sector.

It identifies the critical success factors for the rapid adoption of instant payments. Design/methodology/approach: This study features five country cases where instant payments swiftly alter payment landscapes. These are Brazil’s PIX, India’s UPI, USA’s FedNow, Poland’s Express Elixir and BLIK, and the EU-wide SCT Inst. It discusses and compares all the country cases in detail. Findings: The analysis identified success factors driving the widespread adoption of instant payments. It categorises these factors into five groups, each illustrated by country examples with their respective instant payment systems: regulatory support, an open ecosystem, and inclusive collaboration, network effects on the supply side of the market, network effects on the demand side of the market, and constant development through use and security improvements. Practical implications: This article offers valuable insights for policymakers and developers of instant payment schemes and systems on enhancing network effects and accelerating the adoption of instant payments. Social implications: The introduction of instant payments has profound implications for consumers and businesses. Consumers worldwide increasingly demand real-time payments that are available around the clock. Businesses seek streamlined cash management services that offer faster money flows, helping them reduce risk and exercise more precise control over working capital. Originality/value: The findings contribute to a better understanding of instant payment adoption in various regions and countries, considering their unique characteristics. © 2025, Jakub Górka.},

CBDC can disintermediate the conventional banking industry and produce inflationary pressure through the money supply unless central banks adopt suitable regulatory frameworks to facilitate a seamless transition. On the other hand, a well-structured CBDC can encourage increased financial inclusion, resulting in a favourable outcome on the interest rate pass-through of monetary policy.

	abstract = {Electronic gaming machines (EGMs) are strongly associated with gambling-related harm. Account-based cashless payment systems offer strategic opportunities over anonymous cash-based systems for implementing gambling harm reduction measures. This study assessed the preferences of Australian EGM gamblers toward cashless gambling systems through a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE was designed to quantify the relative importance of different characteristics of hypothetical cashless gambling systems, and to assess willingness to deviate from the existing predominantly cash-based system. Data were analyzed using error components panel models. Responses from 363 Australian adults (Mage = 40.2 years; 30.9% female) who regularly use EGMs were analyzed. Gamblers most preferred a smartphone-based cashless gambling system that operates across multiple venues, involves mandatory self-imposed spending limits, and is linked with a loyalty scheme. Preferences for mandatory limits were stronger among gamblers at higher risk of harm. However, our model predicts that at least 42.5–62.9% of gamblers would not use a cashless system if the option to use cash remains available. Results suggest that uptake of cashless systems depends on the system’s features and is likely to be low for voluntary systems. A mandatory system with binding limits would maximize the potential effectiveness of an account-based system for reducing gambling harm. © 2025 The Author(s).

The analysis becomes more difficult when extended to European countries, which differ in terms of the culture and structure of their tax systems. Despite this, to squelch a phenomenon related to the shadow economy, such as tax evasion, the European Commission has repeatedly stressed that the introduction of a cap on cash payments could be a possible tool for reducing tax evasion. Over time, different methodologies have been used to estimate both the unobserved economy and tax evasion, although the results have nonetheless converged. This does not happen in the formulation of country tax gap rankings, which change depending on whether tax evasion is used in relation to Gross Domestic Product or population. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the levels of tax evasion and the introduction of the cash cap limits in the European countries. The existing tax regulations are different across the countries and not all have placed limits on cash payments. From the econometric estimation, the relationship between the existence of cash payment limits and the reduction in evasion was confirmed only for a threshold exceeding five thousand euros. The other variables considered – such as the tax burden on enterprises and families and the efficiency of the tax system – produce, instead, effects of a very different magnitude. © 2024, ASA Associazione per la Statistica Applicata.

The analysis was conducted by students in Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (FEB UMY). A structured questionnaire was utilized to gather data from 98 participants who satisfied the research criteria. Switching behavior was the dependent variable, and the push, pull, and mooring effects were the independent variables that were measured. Then, by utilizing Smart PLS 4 software, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. The research findings demonstrated that the consumers remained stuck with the cash payment method because the push effect, measured by satisfaction and perceived risk, had a negative and negligible impact on switching behavior. Customers tended to move to mobile payment methods due to the pull effect, which included agreement tendencies, ease of use, and convenience. Statistically, pull effect had a positive and significant impact on switching behavior. In addition, mooring variable positively and significantly impacted switching behavior, which was due to encompassing peer groups, subjective standards, and consumer innovation. These findings suggest that consumer behavior regarding fintech, particularly for students, is complementary rather than substitution in nature. For that reason, transactions among students of FEB UMY combine cash and mobile payments all together. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {This study analyses the difficulties of using stored-value cards for noncash payment adoption and payment framing behaviour development. This study applies the Rasch model via mental accounting theory to identify unobservable and latent difficulties in adopting noncash payment instruments for lottery participation. Anonymity, a reduction in cash carrying, and convenient purchases have discouraged noncash payment adoptions. However, consumers prefer stored-value cards because they are easy to carry and reduce payment time and long waits. Consumers also develop payment framing behaviour difficulties from crediting up to the maximum stored value and fear of insufficient cash, with preferences for period purchases. Lower income significantly discourages noncash payment adoption and payment framing behaviour development, whereas being of a younger age causes significant payment framing difficulties. Regional variations differ in convenience, anonymity, stored value, balance checking, and indirect donations. The moderating effect between income and age also positively significantly influences noncash payment adoption and payment framing behaviour. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The paper then describes how the European Union (EU) legislator is addressing these risks, for example, through the proposed EU Payment Services Regulation and the Instant Payments Regulation, which will introduce such measures as conditional reversal of liability for authorised push payment fraud and confirmation of payee services to enhance fraud prevention and protect consumers, along with efforts to increase the availability and acceptance of cash in order to preserve financial inclusion for vulnerable groups that rely on cash payments. The paper also discusses how the proposed digital euro would function as a backup for payment systems during disruptions, as well as a solution to counter the potential dominance of a third-country central bank digital currency or stablecoin. The paper discusses how many of the legislative measures will require private sector entities to invest in capabilities they would not otherwise invest of their own accord and to cooperate in order to accomplish the public goals set forth by the EU legislator. Put differently, the product development agenda for payment service providers over the coming years will, to a large extent, be driven by the legislator rather than businesses. Some of the required investments will probably be lossmaking, while others could be profitable but may cannibalise existing business. The legislative developments will, therefore, require the identification of both risks and commercial opportunities. © Henry Stewart Publications,.},

When households value privacy, they then face a tradeoff between protecting such privacy and attaining better credit conditions. We study how introducing an informationally more intrusive digital payment vehicle affects households’ cash use, credit access, and welfare. A tech monopolist controls the intrusiveness of the new payment method and manipulates information asymmetries among households and oligopolistic banks to extract data contracts that are more lucrative than lending on its own. The laissez-faire equilibrium entails a digital payment vehicle that is more intrusive than socially optimal, providing a rationale for regulation. © 2025},

However, the quantity of electronic currency in circulation in 2021 has declined compared to 2020 and 2022. Furthermore, the emergence of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a digital currency has problems that cannot be avoided; these problems arise from policies or regulations and understanding of the public and business people and are related to the security of digital currency users. The Bank of Indonesia deems it imperative to address this by implementing suitable policies. The policy encompasses digital payments and financial services, including Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Central banks worldwide are encouraged to develop Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to enhance monetary policy effectiveness. The objective is to guarantee financial stability and enhance the effectiveness and resilience of the payment system. This study aims to examine the concept of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a novel electronic payment tool for social entrepreneurs. The research approach employed in this study was descriptive qualitative with data forecasting. The findings of this study indicate that Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) has the potential to be utilized as a payment instrument by social entrepreneurs. © 2024, SHPMedia Sdn Bhd.

	abstract = {Smart card data (SCD) have been widely used to estimate the effect of built environment on transit ridership. However, most studies have ignored the remaining parts of trips paid in cash, whose share is also sizable, and gives rise to estimation bias in bus travel demand generation. Luckily, the availability of mobile payment replaces most cash-based trips, which renders us to track these trip records. Therefore, this study develops a series of models considering overall, spatial, temporal, and nonlinear effects of built environment on bus ridership. An empirical study is conducted in Nanjing, China, from four weeks of SCD and mobile payment data (MPD) in the bus transit system. The results suggest that mobile payment users generally use bus services less frequently per week compared to smart card users. The inclusion of MPD reveals significant spatial variations in ridership, particularly across accessibility variables. Temporal analysis shows that incorporating MPD is most beneficial in reducing estimation bias during morning and evening peak hours. Furthermore, nonlinear models demonstrate more pronounced effects when both SCD and MPD are considered, especially in identifying threshold effects of the built environment on ridership. This study underscores the importance of adopting new payment methods in transit demand modeling to enhance the accuracy and robustness of bus ridership predictions, providing deeper insights into urban mobility patterns. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Digital payment technology acceptance is well-researched, but the research from the perspective of public transportation drivers is minimal. This study tries to fill this gap by understanding the factors responsible for the choice of payment among public transport drivers. Data from a questionnaire survey designed to elicit information on the factors that influence the choice of payment modes of 261 Public transport drivers in Kota City, India, is used to understand the factors responsible for the choice of payment. Binary Logit, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models were used to analyse the data. The accuracies of the models are compared. Results indicate that income, working hours, and age are the most significant factors that influence the payment mode choice of public transport drivers. Drivers with higher working hours and older age are less likely to choose digital payment modes than cash. Also, bus and taxi drivers are more likely to accept digital payments than auto drivers. Drivers with higher and fixed incomes are more likely to choose digital payments over cash. This study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence payment mode choices of public transport drivers and provides insights valuable for policymakers to encourage the adoption of digital payment modes in the public transportation sector. Policymakers can focus on increasing awareness and trust in digital payment systems among older and higher working-hour drivers while incentivising auto drivers to adopt digital payment systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the financial impacts of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) in USA banking industry. According to this approach, this study is concentrated on M&As in banking industry across the USA to investigate the stock price behavior of targets and acquirers based on the M&A announcement over the period 2000-2010 in a sample of 154 deals. This paper has classified the deals in three main categories; target banks versus acquirer banks, means of payment in M& As (all-cash offers versus all cash and stock offers), and domestic versus cross-border M&As. This classification provides a unique opportunity for analyzing the stock price behavior in different situations and scenarios. This research assumes that there are no other special events in the estimation period (-60, +60) and therefore, has focused on the actual return rather than abnormal return. For the future researches, it's recommended to use the abnormal return instead of the actual return in order to neutralize the movements in prices that result from factors other than the specific announcement under investigation. According to the results generated by this research, M&A announcements generated positive average actual return over (-60, +60) for both target and acquirer banks in all of the scenarios. Average actual return of acquirers' shareholders in M&A announcements of all-cash offers are higher than for all cash-stock offers, but Average actual return of targets' shareholders in M&A announcements of all-cash offers are lower than for all cash-stock offers.},

These deal with the legal tender status of euro cash and the establishment of a digital euro (hereafter “DE”). With the DE, the Commission picks up on a concept that has already been subject of European Central Bank (ECB)-initiatives dating back to 2020. Like the ECB, the Commission aims at a DE that has legal tender status in the euro area. However, it is questionable whether the Treaties allow the introduction of the DE in its proposed form on the legal basis of art.133 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The following contribution will address this issue and will show that sucha n establishment is in conformity with the Treaties. Moreover, it will deal with the proposed provisions on the mandatory acceptance of the DE. © 2025 Thomson Reuters and Contributors.},

	abstract = {As payment methods evolve from cash to digital alternatives, their psychological and behavioural effects on spending behaviours, especially among young consumers, become increasingly important. Previous research has mainly compared credit cards and cash, showing that credit cards lead to more spending. However, the psychological mechanisms behind this are unclear due to differences in coupling time and transparency between the methods. This study bridges the gap by examining not just credit cards and cash, but also prepaid cards and cash, which have a similar coupling between consumption and payment but differ in transparency or payment format. By comparing prepaid cards with cash, the study explores whether the format of payment itself impacts spending behaviour. Drawing from a novel survey of Indonesian college students, this study presents empirical findings that credit card and prepaid card use (extensive margin) and payment frequency (intensive margin) are associated with overspending, whereas cash payments show no such association. The evidence suggests that payment transparency influences consumer behaviour, clarifying the underlying psychological mechanism of how payment methods affect spending. Further analysis shows that higher financial literacy helps mitigate the impact of less transparent payment methods on overspending. These insights suggest opportunities for developing digital payment solutions that minimize negative consequences, particularly for younger users. Educational initiatives tailored to promoting responsible digital payment usage could further reduce these effects. © 2025},

	abstract = {In retail transactions, mobile payment services (MPS) can potentially replace cash, particularly in developing nations that lack card-swipe machines. Due to the concern that currency notes could spread diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak, digital payments saw a rise in popularity as a practical payment alternative. The extended period of the pandemic resulted in an extended period of continued usage, even for new users. Despite having a lengthy trial period, user-friendly interfaces, and greater fungibility than cash, MPS did not find widespread acceptance, and cash still predominates in retail transactions. There is a lot of research on technology adoption, however there is considerably less on usage retention. While there is some literature on continued use of technology, the main factor for discontinuation or reduction of usage is the lack of satisfaction. With MPS, satisfaction is rarely an issue, yet users limit the extent of their usage. In the context of retail transactions, this research explicitly examines continued usage following extensive initial use. The Gioia method of grounded theory was used to investigate the factors preventing continued use of MPS for retail transactions. The qualitative interviews were carried out among users in an emerging economy that is a leader in MPS adoption and use. To explain the barriers to the continued use of beneficial technology, this study proposes a conceptualization of consumer decision inertia with three dimensions categorized as deep-rooted habits, vicarious indifference, and kairotic uncertainty. This insight would be beneficial to MPS organizations not just in developing countries but even for developed economies. The conceptualization of consumer decision inertia also offers insights that can be applied in the context of sustained usage of other consumer-facing technologies. © 2024 Ram Arti Publishers.

Leveraging data from the city's transparency portal, analyses were conducted on passenger numbers, payment methods, and card usage from November 2019 to November 2021. Findings reveal a steady usage of card payments compared to cash, with a notable increase in individual ticket card transactions post-vaccination. Conversely, employer-provided transportation voucher card usage experienced a decline. These trends suggest a preference among users for card-based payments, potentially driven by concerns over direct cash handling and adherence to social distancing guidelines. In conclusion, the study underscores the shifting landscape of public transportation payments in response to the pandemic, highlighting the role of digital solutions in enhancing safety and convenience for passengers.  © 2021 SAE International.},

Using reduced-form econometric analyses, robust to various specifications, we find that participation in the training program is associated with significant positive effects on financial knowledge and financial behavior among young refugees. The findings are important because financial knowledge is essential for saving decisions, responsible borrowing, business operations, and various other life goals among refugees.

At the macroeconomic level, findings reveal how efficient payment systems enhance deposit intermediation, credit creation, and economic growth.

	abstract = {The use of private vehicles can have many negative impacts on various aspects of life. Therefore, the government, as a public service provider, has tried to provide bus-based public transportation services. However, the growth in the number of private vehicles each year continues to increase, while the number of passengers using bus transportation is far below the targeted load factor. This study aims to: 1) assess the perceptions of private vehicle users on the performance of existing bus transportation services; 2) analyze bus service attributes that influence public's desire to switch from using private vehicles, and 3) examine user preferences for using bus as the main mode of transport for their daily mobility. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires distributed to 270 samples of people who live in the districts served by the bus route. The analysis techniques used were descriptive statistics, descriptive qualitative, content analysis, and quantitative analysis. The results showed: 1) the perception of private vehicle users on the performance of existing bus transportation services is dominated by positive comments and responses; 2) bus service attributes that influence public's desire to switch from using private vehicles, namely fare affordability, maintenance of bus stops and buses, and operating hours while the attribute with the smallest influence is the payment system; 3) User preferences for bus transportation services are in the form of security types, media types, and operating hours show compatibility with existing services. For walking and cycling distances, respondents chose <100 meters for walking and <500 meters for cycling; besides that, the majority of respondents prefer fares below current prices and feel comfortable with cash payment methods.

On one hand, auditory feedback enhances consumers' sense of control over the payment, leading to increased transaction satisfaction. On the other hand, it also intensifies consumers' pain of payment, resulting in decreased transaction satisfaction. Nevertheless, our study reveals an overall positive effect of auditory feedback on transaction satisfaction. We examined the moderating role of shopping motivation (functional vs. hedonic) and found that auditory feedback can enhance transaction satisfaction for consumers with functional shopping motivation and decrease it for consumers with hedonic shopping motivation. We also explored the moderating role of quick response (QR) code payments (dependent payment vs. autonomous payment) and observed a positive effect of auditory feedback on transaction satisfaction for dependent payment but not for autonomous payment. These findings contribute to the broader research on mobile payments and retailers aiming to enhance consumers' transaction experience. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

The internet has dispensed with the need to send faxes across telephone wires. The days when it was necessary to carry multiple currencies across the international borders have all but disappeared. The day is fast approaching when societies will be cashless and people will be able to carry so-called smart cards that contain all of their funds in the form of electronic cash. Smart cards have the technical ability to facilitate transfers of electronic cash from one smart card to another. Electronic cash can be used to shop on the internet and even gamble there. The shares of a company can be bought and sold on multiple stock exchanges through electronic cash transactions. When a London stock exchange is closed, for example, a person in the UK might transmit electronic cash to New York and buy publicly traded shares because the stock exchanges in New York will be open. If a citizen of one country loses faith in the national currency, he might use an electronic cash transaction to convert his assets into the stronger currency of another country in a foreign bank account.

This paper investigates the macroeconomic and distributional effects of different CBDC regimes within a New Keynesian model with a heterogeneous household sector. Households prefer to hold part of their income in CBDC as a means of payment as it facilitates transactions. If they cannot hold their preferred share of CBDC, they will face transaction costs. We find that the introduction of a binding limit on CBDC holdings can increase the shock absorption capabilities of an economy. If the limit is used as a monetary policy instrument, prices will be stabilized more effectively after shocks. However, a CBDC implies distributional effects across households. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The rise of wireless communication has spurred the global adoption of mobile payment services, a trend that is significantly reducing the use of cash. This shift, driven by new technologies and lifestyle changes, not only presents opportunities for businesses but also enhances consumers’ daily activities. Consumers’ and businesses’ willingness to adopt mobile payment services has increased due to factors such as easier access to new technologies, convenience, changing lifestyle choices, and economic conditions. Despite challenges such as limited access to technology, security concerns, and high transaction fees, the potential benefits of mobile payment services are promising. Therefore, this research aims to construct a suitable model for developing a mobile payment service framework that both consumers and businesses are willing to adopt. The proposed model integrates the Delphi method, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), quality function deployment (QFD), an analytic network process (ANP), and fuzzy set theory. To demonstrate the practical application of the model, a case study of developing a mobile payment service framework is presented, showcasing how the model can be used to address real-world challenges and enhance the adoption of mobile payment services. The case study results show that ease of use, system and service quality, and reliability are the most important customer requirements, and encryption, edge computing, authentication, and interoperability are the most important engineering characteristics. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a pivotal innovation in the financial landscape. However, a fundamental challenge arises when considering the inherent nature of retail CBDCs: the potential loss of transactional anonymity, a hallmark feature of physical cash. This paper posits that while direct digital representations of currency may struggle to maintain user anonymity due to traceable digital footprints, tokenization could offer a solution. However, tokenized CBDCs would require users to engage with hardware wallets and third-party storage solutions, initially presenting a barrier due to the general public's unfamiliarity with such technologies. We propose that broad tokenization may address these challenges. As tokenization spreads and the upcoming generation becomes proficient in handling private keys, CBDCs could mirror cash's anonymity. This paper highlights the role of financial and IT education in building trust in tokenization and bridging the anonymity gap between digital and physical currencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An elegant and probably new divisible transferable anonymous electronic cash system with observer is proposed in this paper. The proposed divisible e-cash solves most of the crucial problem with existing paper cash and untraceable e-cash proposals. Electronic cash provides unconditional anonymity to the user. Researchers observed, however, that if anonymity in payment systems is unconditional, it might be exploited to facilitate crimes like money laundering. This observation spurred research into the idea of making anonymity in payment systems conditional, and, in particular, revocable by a third party or trustee or observer under bank’s order. An observer is a tamper resistant device that prevents doublespending physically. The user module is called a wallet since, it actually carries money. The idea of having an observer is that it can be incorporated in the wallet in such a way that no user module can do a transaction on its own. For any transaction protocol to be executed by the wallet, it needs help (a secret information) from the observer. The advantage of the proposed electronic cash system is that it is able to construct an observer capable of co-operating with divisible and transferable e-cash. A user who generates a divisible coin can transfer his any divisible amount of e-cash to another user and to a number of users subsequently without losing anonymity and without contacting the bank between the two transactions. Due to the presence of observer, the proposed e-cash has prior resistance of double spending. In each transfer of divisible e-cash, coin authentication and denomination revelation is checked to verify the validity of divisible e-cash. In any stage of coin transfer, the anonymity is guaranteed with protection of double spending. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Near Field Communication (NFC) is gaining increasing attention as a highly convenient, short-range, contactless communication method. It has garnered interest primarily due to its user-friendly support for mobile payment, and it has been widely used in various mobile devices for some time now. The popularity of NFC is on the rise, thanks to the rapid proliferation of NFC-enabled devices in the market. This technology facilitates data transfer between devices when brought into proximity. It is primarily designed for seamless integration with mobile phones, enabling them to communicate with other phones through peer-to-peer connections and read or write information on NFC tags and cards using a compatible reader. Apple Pay, Google’s Wallet, Samsung Pay, and Cash App have successfully integrated NFC technology for mobile transactions. However, as with any wireless technology that experiences widespread adoption, NFC is not immune to security concerns. It can be vulnerable to several security-related attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle, denial of service (DOS), and relay attacks.

	abstract = {Purpose: Economic policymakers consistently leverage monetary policies as a pivotal factor in achieving targeted economic goals, utilizing them as an influential driver for economic growth. On one hand, the advent of modern monetary tools and the widespread adoption of electronic money and payment systems can significantly influence the money supply, banking reserves, monetary base, the velocity of money circulation, and the multiplier effect. This, in turn, can shadow the impact of monetary policies on economic variables such as inflation and economic growth. On the other hand, banks play a crucial role in the development, expansion, and adoption of novel payment instruments, potentially affecting macroeconomic policies and variables. Hence, this study aims to examine the impact of electronic money and innovative payment instruments on monetary aggregates, taking into account the intermediary role of banks. Methodology: Therefore, in this study, to study the subject, panel data technique, simultaneous equations, vector regression model and data from 1370 to 1398 were used. Findings: Based on the results, the expansion of electronic money and payment instruments lead to increased liquidity and inflation. Also, banks play a significant role in these variables by controlling the amount of payment instruments and innovations in them. On the other hand, the spread of e-money causes to achieve the targeted effects through exchange rate monetary policy and legal reserve rate. With less changes in these rates, but in order to achieve the goals of monetary policy applied through interest rates on account, more changes should be considered in these rates. Originality/Value: The output of this research is to provide a solution for implementing optimal monetary policy in view of the increasing use of new payment instruments and can help monetary policy makers in implementing effective policies. © 2024, Research Expansion Alliance (REA).

This type of research is literature research, using qualitative descriptive methods. Its approach is through normative and empirical legal approaches in the form of case studies. The results of this study concluded that based on the propositions of the Qur’an and hadith and the opinions of fiqh scholars, basically doing business is allowed as long as there is no element of gambling, fraud, riba, gharar, and dharar. In the case of online buying and selling with the COD payment system, if the goods sold are halal, it is clear that the quality and quantity of goods are between those offered by the seller and those received by the buyer; the payment is no element of fraud and addition, except for the postage agreed at the beginning, then according to Sharia economic law, the law can (mubah). However, conversely, if the practice of buying and selling online with COD payments, there are elements of gharar (unclear goods), riba (additional price without replacement), tadlis (fraud), and dharar (danger) that have an impact on harming sellers or buyers, then the law is haram. © 2024, Fatmawati Sukarno Bengkulu State Islamic University.

	abstract = {The results of a survey of 1,071 adults in the United States reveal that most consumers do not pay attention to, let alone understand, arbitration clauses in their everyday lives. The vast majority of survey respondents (over 97%) report having opened an account with a company that requires disputes to be submitted to binding arbitration (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Cash App, a phone or cable company), yet most are unaware that they have, in fact, agreed to mandatory arbitration (also known as “forced arbitration”). Indeed, over 99% of respondents who think they have never entered into an arbitration agreement likely have done so. Over 92% of respondents report that they have never based a decision to use a product or service on whether the terms and conditions contain an arbitration agreement. When prompted, they largely endorse the following reasons: they were unaware of the arbitration clause, they did not read the terms and conditions, and they thought they had no choice but to agree to mandatory arbitration. Moreover, many respondents presume that if a dispute arises, they will still be able to access the public courts, notwithstanding that they agreed to the terms and conditions. Consumers are largely unaware of opportunities to opt out of mandatory arbitration. They generally do not pay attention to or retain information about the steps required to opt out successfully (e.g., contacting the company within a specified time period). Generally, consumers are unaware that companies like Cash App and Venmo (mobile payment systems utilized by nearly 60% of respondents) allow customers to opt out of mandatory arbitration if they act within a limited time period. Among the minority of respondents (21%) who stated that they had been given an opportunity to opt out, vanishingly few could name any of the steps required to opt out successfully. When presented with a run-of-the-mill contract, of the type consumers routinely encounter, most respondents did not take notice of the arbitration clause. Less than 5% of respondents could recall that the contract they were shown had said anything at all about arbitration. Furthermore, most consumers misperceive the consequences of signing a predispute arbitration agreement. Most mistakenly believe that, after agreeing to terms and conditions mandating binding arbitration, they can still choose to settle their dispute in court, have a jury decide their case, join a class action, and appeal a decision made based on a legal error. For instance, less than 5% of respondents correctly reported that they could neither appeal an erroneous decision to another arbitrator (or set of arbitrators) nor start all over again in court. Less than 1% of respondents correctly understood the full significance of the arbitration agreement, as indicated by their responses to questions about whether they retained the rights to sue, have a jury decide their case, access the public courts, and appeal a decision based on a legal error. In summary, consumers are generally unaware of arbitration clauses, and they tend to hold mistaken beliefs about how arbitration agreements affect consumers’ procedural rights. © 2024 Roseanna Sommers.

	abstract = {Research background: The development of innovative technologies has contributed to significant changes in the market for payment instruments. These changes have become a challenge for banks and have contributed to the continuous expansion of the products they offer, more technologically advanced, which will provide the customer with a high level of security. Banks, in order to meet customer expectations, are developing and improving the most popular distribution channels for their services, which are undoubtedly payment cards. Purpose: The aim of the paper is to define and classify non-cash payment instruments in the Polish payment card market from 2009 to 2023, as well as to assess the trends of changes that may occur in the payment card market at the end of 2024 and in 2025. Research methodology: A study of the payment card market in Poland was carried out, and the factors determining the development of non-cash payments were presented, as well as the directions of its future changes. Development trend (trend) models were used for the study, and then used to forecast the changes that will take place in the payment card market in Poland at the end of 2024 and in 2025.The analysis was carried out using the program STATISTICA 13.3. Results: Bank customers are increasingly carrying out transactions using electronic payment instruments, the most common form of which are payment cards. The payment card is one of the better options for obtaining funds, as evidenced by the systematic annual increase in the number of such cards issued. The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the increase of payment card use in Poland. Novelty: Further advances in technology will bring new solutions to the payment card market and at the same time develop the digital money market. The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly accelerated the payment needs and expectations of consumers, who are more willing to use digital technologies in the new reality. Banks, in turn, see modern technological solutions as achieving a competitive advantage in the market. © 2024 Sciendo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The study draws upon both unpublished as well as published sources to describe the structure of, and changes in, agricultural trade and markets at the regional and local level in the British India districts of Shahabad and Gaya, spanning parts of the current state of Bihar, in northern India during 1800–1920.Agricultural trade and markets during the period under study were largely shaped by the logic of subsistence agriculture, available infrastructure, the land rent payment system and patterns of demand. There were six striking developments. First, the construction of all-weather roads and the railway, part of the modern public infrastructure put in place soon after the administration of the two districts came directly under the British Crown in 1858, gave a great fillip to trading activity. Old trade routes lost their pre-eminence, as new channels took root. The modern infrastructure also tended to integrate the markets in the two districts on the one hand, while increasing the pulls of external markets on the other. This was reflected in greater price equalisation between markets. Second, notwithstanding greater market integration and increased stability in annual farm yields on account of the construction of modern irrigation canals that reduced the reliance on monsoonal precipitation, sharp seasonal fluctuations in the market price of food grains continued. Third, there was a sustained secular upswing in agricultural prices practically throughout the period, with the terms of trade moving in favour of agriculture, as the entry of mass produced wage goods into local markets had a deflationary impact on industrial goods. This, along with the growing depth of trade and markets, and changes in the land rent payment system, facilitated the rise of a new social group that became a new source of demand and was to subsequently play a major role in the emerging political economy. Fourth, there were three inter-dependent tiers of trading activity—long-distance trade conducted by arhatiyas, trade between major trade centres conducted by ladu beparis and trade within the village dominated by the grihasta bepari, the chief source of agricultural credit and frequently an agriculturist himself. Modern infrastructure transformed the conduct of long-distance trade, even as the pattern of short-distance trade and credit remained remarkably resilient. The fifth feature was the sharp and sudden expansion of the range of products traded in the market, as the latter was drawn into the emerging global system with the first industrial nation at the epicentre. While locally produced handicraft products like indigenous cotton cloth and paper lost their former importance, trade in agricultural commodities and imported industrial goods grew. Sixth, and last, was the increase in the monetisation of the rural economy at the cutting edge as the traditional system of paying rent in kind was commuted to cash. © 2015 ICHR SAGE Publications.},

Most of the e-cash systems proposed so far do not provide transferability. Those who support transferability are either inefficient or requiring to be online with the help of a trustee. In this paper we present an efficient offline transferable e-cash system. The computational complexity of our system is as light as a single term e-cash system [13]. Besides, no trustee is involved in the transfer protocol. In addition to it, we propose two e-check systems constructed using similar techniques to our e-cash system. One is as efficient as a single term e-cash system and supports partial unlinkability. The other one provides complete unlinkability with a more complex setting.

	abstract = {Investigating the correlation between digital financial services, mobile money usage, and money velocity in Ghana, the study analysed time series data spanning from 1992 to 2022. A composite index was constructed by principal component analysis using data extracted from the world development indicators, with the components mobile money usage, digital financial services, and velocity of money. The estimation utilised an impulse response function and vector error correction model; the results indicated that mobile money, digital financial services, and money velocity are related in both the short and long term. Furthermore, the application of a standard deviation innovation to the velocity of money produced increases of both positive and negative magnitude for all the variables. This suggests that mobile money, digital banking services, and velocity of money in Ghana are interdependent in an asymmetric manner. In order to facilitate an increase in the velocity of money, the research concluded that policymakers should guarantee that a greater proportion of the population has access to mobile money and digital banking services. In addition to promoting mobile money, online banking services, and digital payment methods on purpose, the government should reduce reliance on physical currency and expedite the circulation of money. It is recommended that future longitudinal studies involving African nations employ diverse estimation techniques. © 2024, Econjournals. All rights reserved.},

Case overview/synopsis: Rajani Chandran, a seasoned financial analyst, relooks her recommendation of Paytm in light of the recent revocation of its Payment Bank License. Paytm, the flagship service of One97 Communications Ltd., a financial technology company, is a pioneer in the Indian digital payments and financial services market. However, the developments post going public in 2021 were not always favorable. The frequent fallout with Reserve Bank of India brought restrictions on onboarding new customers and ultimately the revocation of the license. This drastic move is of huge concern to those who have invested in the company. Thus, given this backdrop, Rajani initially explored the dynamic landscape of the Indian digital payments and fintech industry, considering macroeconomic factors, competition and regulatory dynamics. She delved into Paytm’s financial performance to gauge its position in the market. The next phase of the careful scrutiny involved arriving at the equity value of the venture using the discounted cash flow model. Finally, Rajani critically appraised the drivers of valuation, incorporating both quantitative and the story she has crafted around Paytm. Consequently, participants in this case study are prompted to evaluate Paytm and arrive at a valuation and furnish a comprehensive recommendation based on their analyses, thus understanding the intricacies of evaluating a fintech company with immense potential. This case study serves as a valuable resource for students seeking to comprehend the complexities of financial analysis and valuation within the context of a dynamic and evolving industry landscape. Complexity academic level: The case is best suited for a course on Financial Statement Analysis while discussing how the financial statements of new-age tech companies can be analyzed and Business Valuation while introducing DCF valuation. The case serves as a comprehensive example of the multifaceted challenges and considerations that a buy-side analyst should have while valuing a company and pitching an investment within the fintech industry.

	abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, we ask: how do individual factors affect individuals’ intentions of adopting fast payment systems (FPS)? We examine the role of financial literacy and beliefs about cash as individual-related variables that complement the technology acceptance model (TAM) in explaining the individuals’ intention to adopt financial innovations. Design/methodology/approach: We surveyed consumers in 11 Latin American countries to measure relevant variables. By applying structural equation modeling, we extended the TAM. We demonstrated that financial literacy and beliefs about cash contribute to developing a fine-grained understanding of what stimulates individuals’ adoption of financial innovations like FPS. Findings: Our results support the claim that individuals with higher levels of financial literacy exhibit a higher intention to adopt FPS through the mediation role of beliefs about cash, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude. Practical implications: To improve FPS’s acceptance probability, designers must add highly usable platforms. However, it could be more important to increase the perceived usefulness of FPS as the system competes directly with traditional payment methods such as cash. If individuals exhibit strong positive beliefs about cash, their attitudes and intentions of adopting FPS will decrease. In addition, policymakers and designers may modify beliefs about cash individuals exhibit by identifying and intervening in their determinants (e.g. financial literacy). Originality/value: Besides technology-related factors, we demonstrate that beliefs about alternative technologies (e.g. cash) influence the intention to adopt financial innovations like FPS. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

But existing relevant literature is silent about how agents’ expectations become coordinated. This paper resolves the coordination problem in the use of a non-deferred electronic means of payment, which can be represented by a debit card. We focus on that because it is almost a perfect substitute for cash. The presence of exogenous shocks that have a fundamental impact on the cost of the technology makes agents coordinate their expectations in a particular way. We also show that a high inflation and a distortionary financing scheme for debit-card transactions cost disturb coordination in the use of debit cards. © 2015, Korean Economic Association.

	abstract = {In the contemporary digital era, internet usage had been significantly increased. All age groups generate and use a lot of data per second. The ease of smartphones and the virtual accessibility of goods and services have transformed in a fashion where customers can buy and pay for items online. The early attempts in e-commerce relied on majorly a cash on delivery method. Digital payments encompass a broad spectrum of financial activities, ranging from online shopping and the use of contactless payment cards to money transfers via peer-to-peer platforms and mobile wallets. The widespread adoption of these digital payment services has led to exponential growth in their usage by millions of people worldwide. In order to educate the customers about the new online sector and to earn their trust, the current study aimed to understand the perception of online shoppers towards digital payments apps. The primary data from 150 respondents were collected using a random sampling method. The statistical tools used for analysing data are Correlation, ANOVA and Weighted Average Analysis. Based on ANOVA, there is no relationship between age, gender and the influencing variables to use digital payment. A comparison has been made between the demographic variable of age and the satisfactory level of online shopping while doing digital payment app. There is a relationship between the different levels of age group with the dependent variable by using ANOVA. The result depicts that the respondents are more convenient and satisfied with the digital payment apps. Respondents are also aware of the digital payment option over the traditional payment method which includes cash on deposit. Yet still they are hesitant about security and privacy. Thus, despite businesses best efforts should be taken towards the same to attract them in utilizing digital payment platforms and to promote their products. Also, by improving the user interface consumer confidence can be increased.  © 2024 Author(s).},

However, many such programs are not successful. Hence there is a need to understand the critical factors which contribute to the success of e-micropayment programs. This study used i-cash; an electronic wallet introduced and used in 7-Eleven, the largest convenience store chain in Taiwan, for such an investigation. Furthermore, i-cash was used for an additional reason. With the recent regulatory relaxation; it is now possible for i-cash to be transformed from a single purpose, retail-based e-micropayment to a multi-purpose one. Through the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, this study shows that network effect plays a very important role in the success of e-micropayment system and is also instrumental in the transformation of a single-purpose e-micropayment program to a multi-purpose one. The factors influencing the development of e-micropayment programs are highly inter-related and in fact, re-enforce one another, leading to positive feedback and bandwagon effect. It is found that factors such as reliability, more value-add locations, acceptance by merchants and users not only increase the popularity of the system, they also affects and re-enforces other factors through a positive feedback loop. © 2009 IADIS.},

	abstract = {Technology has transformed payment systems. Regulated digital money transactions are replacing traditional cash transactions. However, policy frameworks on payment systems often neglect to consider the diverse needs of society despite the critical role that payment systems play in society. This can be seen by the increasingly mandatory use of electronic money, which may exclude groups who have relied on traditional cash transactions but have unequal technological access. This paper explores the importance of electronic money accessibility from the perspective of Indonesian court decisions. This study reveals that current implementations, policies, and court decisions regarding electronic money have mainly focused on effectiveness rather than inclusivity. Electronic money was created to help unbaked people access financial services. However, ensuring people have technological access to these services must include everyone. This study recommends that policymakers ensure that electronic money services are accessible to the unbanked and those with limited technology access when promoting their use. On top of that, the government must also reinforce that using rupiah, in any form, remains a legal means of payment and must be respected in all transactions. © 2025, Bank Indonesia Institute.

Following Lagos and Wright (2005) we model explicitly some frictions in the exchange process considering money as essential. We introduce in this theoretical framework, theft and informality (measured by tax evasion), as factors affecting cash usage and, therefore competition with an electronic payment method. In this paper, segmentation in the payments market is considered by introducing heterogeneity in the seller's side, assuming different levels of productivity to explain the preference for cash or for electronic payments. Considering the above, the provision of the electronic payment platform is modeled under three different market structures to identify the effects of the distortions comparing the results with the social planner solution. In the first case, the electronic payment platform is provided by a public firm as a free service; in the second case a private monopoly provides the platform at a positive cost, and in the third case the conditions for the existence of a mixed duopoly are derived. The existence of a public provider in the electronic payments market could lead private networks to provide these services at a lower cost than in the monopoly case, increasing the coverage of digital payments and reducing cash usage, which implies gains in social welfare. This paper gives a theoretical basis and key insights to the discussions regarding public provision of new payment services when the market is already served by private suppliers. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This study investigates public perception and the factors influencing the widespread adoption of the eNaira, Nigeria's Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The eNaira aims to ensure secure transactions, encourage financial inclusion, and support the drive for a cashless society, yet adoption rates have fallen short of expectations. Using an online survey form, we gathered data from 467 respondents, focusing on factors such as privacy concerns, convenience, and financial inclusion. Our analysis of the data, employing one-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and correlation tests revealed interesting insights. Findings indicate that eNaira is believed to be a valuable digital payment option, also its perceived convenience and ability to reduce reliance on cash are significant for its acceptance. Education levels greatly impacted people's belief in the eNaira, with less educated people showing more faith in government adoption strategies. This study emphasizes the importance of tailored adoption strategies that respond to demographic variations. By addressing these variables, decision-makers and interested parties can create efficient plans to encourage the broad implementation of the eNaira and other CBDCs. © 2024 IEEE.},

Developed technology enables a plethora of new conveniences not before available. Because increasingly advanced technology encourages individuals to conduct all transactions digitally and is simple to use, payment systems based on electronic money have emerged and are often utilized for daily transactions. These technical advancements also have an effect on the community’s lifestyle and payment systems, since they enable the replacement of cash payments with more efficient and convenient electronic payment systems based on electronic money (e-money). The purpose of this research is to ascertain the consequences of utilizing electronic money as a contemporary payment mechanism that is often utilized by individuals for purchasing and selling activities. Electronic money is similar to currency in that it may be carried and stored anywhere. The usage of simple to use electronic money is anticipated to improve consumers’ transactional convenience and may continue to be the community’s preferred payment transaction instrument in the digital era. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The primary purpose of this study is to examine the influence of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) on the use of mobile money in Indonesia. The acceptance of technology has brought changes to society where the application of technology is aimed at identifying the best solution among the various existing alternatives. There are two types of electronic money: chip-based and server-based electronic money. Server-based electronic money is found on mobile phones. The Indonesian government has encouraged the use of electronic money and launched Less Cash Society to create a secure, efficient, and smooth payment system. Research design, data, and methodology: This study collected quantitative data from users of server-based electronic money through surveys conducted based on the sample size. The data were processed using SEM LISREL 8.70. Results: the results show that each of the TAM’s fundamental elements has a significant impact. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are able to encourage attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use towards actual use. Conclusions: The distribution of mobile money has a positive impact on society. Hence, mobile money providers must simplify access—recommendations made to strengthen the acceptance of mobile money via Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness. © Copyright: The Author This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

Our main results are: (i) CBDC always increases the welfare of financially unconstrained households; however, it increases the welfare of constrained households when the cost of carrying cash is high enough and when the government purchase level is sufficiently low; (ii) CBDC increases the fiscal income by bringing more agents out of the informal economy, improving fiscal sustainability; (iii) CBDC improves the terms of trade as it strengthens the domestic currency. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The role of the NSPK in ensuring the national security of the country in the payment sphere is analyzed. The prerequisites for the creation of the NSPK, the history of the sanctions impact on the Russian banking and payment sector are investigated, the features of the implementation of the system are considered and the factors affecting its operation are evaluated. The current state of the system and its place in the Russian payment market are analyzed. Forecasts are made regarding the further development of the NSPK. Recommendations are given to improve the efficiency of the NSPK functioning. The creation of the national payment card system was dictated primarily by the need to ensure Russia’s national security in the settlement and payment sphere in the face of unprecedented economic and political pressure from Western countries. Unlike international card payment systems, NSPK was initially focused on working in the domestic market. With the departure of Visa and Mastercard from Russia, the domestic payment system received the status of a monopolist in the country. In addition, one of the priorities was to establish cooperation with foreign partners to increase the number of countries where the NSPK’s payment card Mir is accepted, in addition, special attention was paid to the development of co-baging projects. The key advantages of the NSPK: increasing the stability of the payment space functioning, reducing the current costs of making retail non-cash payments, independence from the governments of unfriendly countries and international organizations, ensuring reliable protection of payment information, reducing the turnover of cash and, accordingly, the costs of its provision. © 2023, Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {To motivate wider adoption, proponents of token-based digital currencies have advocated for their use for financial inclusion. Token-based currencies are closer to cash than are intermediated account-based ones (e.g., M-Pesa), which is important since cash is the least financially excluding form of money. However, in-depth evidential studies have concluded that the narrative appears compelling only in niche cases. In this paper, a re-examined exploration of the narrative, drawing from an IT Affordance lens, is presented. The paper explores how the recently introduced concept of an intermediary ecosystem can hinder or enable a financially excluded person's potential use of stablecoins to fulfill goals associated with financial inclusion affordances. The possibility that stablecoin functionalities could be integrated into, for example, community-based initiatives like Latin American tandas is explored. Hence, reframing through the lens of IT affordance reinforces that blockchain-based tokenized digital currencies could strengthen benevolent intermediaries' ability to aid financially excluded persons. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

	abstract = {The act of reusing products and materials offers numerous benefits from reducing the amount of waste that goes into landfills to lowering the need for manufacturing that would save energy. Educational institutes with residential facilities have the potential to generate reusable items like clothes, books, electronic items, etc. But students do not put much effort to give these reusable items a second life partly because of the inconvenience and lack of opportunity. Various digital applications have come up with services that offer the owners of the products to sell and earn instead of discarding them away without giving them a second chance. However, there are several areas and localities where these applications are not quite popular because of certain factors like limited products, payment options, customer availability, focus on specific areas, etc. This paper aims at studying the need for a digital platform that would focus on residential educational institutions encouraging the students to reuse products and experience an innovative payment approach that would address the issue of needing cash for urgent transactions. To validate the need, a user survey was conducted among 100 students who reside in a residential institute. Based on the survey result, an innovative service design process has been developed which was followed by app design, prototyping, and testing. The study also explores the feasibility of an innovative payment approach through a coupon-based cash transaction system for localized use. Further, the study involves a user review to validate and improve the practical implementation of the application. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Higher educational institutions, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of our society, have embraced digital transformation. This study presents the processes for paying student fees in higher institutions of learning in Zambia are inefficient, inconvenient, and time-consuming. Traditional methods, like cash or checks, are still common for student fee payments in higher educational institutions. The growing student population has resulted in long queues and overcrowding in financial institutions and universities, causing inconvenience. This study aimed to design and implement a secure payment gateway system specifically tailored for higher institutions of learning in Zambia. The primary objective of this system is to seamlessly integrate with university applications and various payment service providers, facilitating a diverse range of payment methods through microservices using web services to streamline and automate payment processes, addressing challenges encountered by both students and institutions, such as student’s in-person visits to banks for payments. The gateway aims to enhance the overall payment experience and leading to increased efficiency. The study utilized a closed-ended questionnaire administered by the researcher. The primary data collected from the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS and Excel. Through a comprehensive literature review and questionnaire surveys, this study demonstrates that the implementation of this payment gateway substantially reduces the necessity for manual intervention, allowing administrative personnel to allocate their time more strategically.

	abstract = {Digital transformation is the adoption of digital technologies to improve an organisation’s processes, services and products. In microfinance institutions (MFIs), this can result in improved operational efficiency, risk management, revenues and customer experience (Redaelli et al., 2021). Automating administrative processes, reducing costs and loan processing times and improving cash management are all ways of optimising operational efficiency. In addition, the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and blockchain can help improve credit decision-making and risk management (Tufail et al., 2021). Such technologies make it feasible to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, track repayments and reduce losses from defaults. In addition, participatory finance platforms and online payment systems can diversify funding and reduce dependence on traditional bank lending (Sanaa Rizkallah, 2021). The purpose of this study is to investigate the contribution of digital transformation to the organisational performance of MFIs. To this aim, the study will examine the existing literature in order to establish a theoretical basis based on concrete cases of MFIs that have adopted digital transformation to improve their organisational performance. Finally, it will highlight the success factors and barriers encountered during the implementation of these successful initiatives. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {In an increasingly digitalized society, payment methods are undergoing a significant evolution that alters the transactional dynamics of consumers. The objective of this study is to analyze the adoption of digital payment methods in Zone 5 of Ecuador, focusing on the behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of users. Using a quantitative methodology, the relationship with online payments through mobile applications is examined in a sample of 475 consumers. The results reveal a predominance of women, employees, and people aged 25 to 44 in the consumer market, with those with a university education, formal employment, and residence in urban areas being more likely to use digital methods. Despite the acceptance of debit and credit cards, cash is still preferred, especially for in-person purchases. The findings also indicate that the province of Guayas concentrates the largest number of users, most of whom are in the middle and low income ranges. It is concluded that there is still a lack of confidence in digital payments, and there is a clear need to address user concerns to promote the adoption of innovative, secure and convenient payment methods. © (2024), (Universidad del Zulia).

	abstract = {The concept of digital cash has the potential to completely change how people think about money. Digital currency has emerged as a possible alternative for exchanging currency and traditional payment systems, in addition to a popular investment option due to its potential for high returns. One of the three main varieties of digital currency is cryptocurrency that is secured by blockchain technology. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies exist in crypto markets. Investing in cryptocurrencies still carries risks and uncertainties due to the price volatility. It is thus important to approach such investments with caution and thoroughly research the market and its risks before making investment decisions. This paper presents an application of AI technology for learning the price movement of Ethereum (ETH) which is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. Based on the Technical factor, the XGBoost model is constructed for classification of return on Ethereum close price. The technical indicators such as moving averages and relative strength index, together with the Bitcoin price trend are chosen to determine influence on Ethereum price further used for computing the short-term return separate into 3 classes: downtrend, sideway, and uptrend. The model performance is measured by multiclass ROC-AUC, achieving the micro-average ROC-AUC of 0.66 saying the model is reasonably good at predicting the overall trend of ETH price.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {The people of India sought digital modes of payment during the demonetization period in India (2016); with the increasing growth of the internet, electronic commerce (e-commerce) websites have become imperative for securely accessing payment gateways, encouraging the growth of digital payment processes and payment app development. During the pandemic, there was an exponential increase in mobile payments using smartphones. The usage of mobiles and their market penetration with government schemes such as ‘Digital India’ accelerated the use of mobile payments by a large percentage of customers in the coastal hinterland (Manipal) of India. This study aimed to analyze the critical factors influencing digital payments in the university town of Manipal. From the literature, 13 regressors were shortlisted, and their effect was measured against a behavioral intention to use mobile payments. A structured and validated questionnaire is used as a research tool for data collection that is analyzed using structural equation modeling. The structure equation modeling included using smart partial least squares (SPLS), in which path coefficients, t-statistics, and consistency tests were conducted. The investigation found that ease of use, social influence, perceived behavioral control, rewards and offers, credibility, compatibility, perceived cost, impact on the environment, and government schemes have a positive influence on m-payments. Social influence has a strong influence on m-payments and is a direct enabler of technology acceptance. The critical factors were identified by using smart PLS as being ease of use and social influence, which were identified as the critical factors concerning m-payments. © 2023 by the authors.

	abstract = {More and more people pay using cashless payment methods rather than paying cash. In addition to online stores, more and more stores in the real world accept cashless payments, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. However, people notice that using cashless payments makes them spend more than necessary unconsciously. Some applications would notify the amount of payment on the cashless payment, but they are just after-notices and rarely draw people’s feeling to the money spent. A better method is required to prevent wasting money before payment. In this paper, we implement eight user interfaces to avoid waste on mobile payment applications. These interfaces would inhibit users’ payment actions for several seconds before they make the final confirmation. We compared the eight user interfaces through evaluation experiments with 25 participants. We found features of the user interfaces that were suitable for preventing waste. In evaluation experiments, we gave a shopping scenario with wasting, and we asked the participants to use the implemented user interface. The participants answered the degree of effect of wasting prevention about the implemented user interface. They also answered the degree of frustration in using the assigned user interface. Experimental results showed that the participants would escape from wasting more if the user interface gave a pleasant task in specific periods. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The provision of safe and easily available drinking water is of utmost importance for the well-being and continued existence of the human population. Nevertheless, a multitude of locations encounter difficulties in ensuring the accessibility of cost-effective and environmentally sustainable potable water. To tackle this issue, we put up a novel water vending system that incorporates RFID and IoT technologies. The focal point of the research inquiry is the provision of potable water that is both safe and affordable. This project aims to bring about a significant transformation in the water vending sector by implementing a system that improves customer satisfaction, fosters environmental sustainability, and streamlines financial operations. The approach used in this study included the utilization of RFID technology for user authentication and the customization of water distribution volumes based on individual preferences. The use of a sonar sensor facilitates a user-friendly mode of engagement, giving individuals the ability to manipulate the flow of water by manual gestures. The integration of smartphones enables the convenient process of topping up cards, hence reducing the need to use physical currency. The primary findings are improved water availability, waste reduction, and optimized financial transactions. The implementation of routine cleaning procedures and continuous monitoring of water quality guarantees the provision of clean water. This approach plays a significant role in mitigating water shortages, reducing dependence on bottled water, and promoting environmental sustainability by using biodegradable packaging. The suggested system addresses the issues associated with water vending via the use of RFID and IoT technologies. This solution provides an automated, user-friendly, and environmentally conscientious method for the provision of clean water. © 2024 IEEE.},

For this appraisal, focus is especially put on the interpretation of the notions ‘legal tender’, ‘banknotes’, and ‘coins’ referred to in Art. 128 TFEU; the analysis is supported by experiences drawn from the legal discussion in the United States. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Research background:The relative inertia in holding cash, despite the increasing importance of electronic payments, is one of the most fascinating puzzles of the current monetary system and a significant issue for central bank policy. In our study, we would like to extend the previous considerations regarding holding cash by consumers who have decided to make electronic payments but keep the cash despite this. Purpose of the article: Recent literature mainly considers the trade-off between cash and electronic payments. We go beyond this dual framework and instead focus on the precautionary demand for cash. We study the relevance of several psychological factors behind cash holding by consumers who have decided to use electronic payments. Methods: We employ factor analysis and logistic regression. We use data from a standardized online survey conducted among Polish consumers. Findings & value added: Our study's key determinants of holding cash include risk-taking behavior, perceived risk of the unavailability of the payment infrastructure and perceived attitudes towards cash (flexibility and cybersecurity related to the lack of exposure to cyberattacks). According to our research, consumers attach great importance to the flexibility that cash gives as an additional option to electronic payments. A better understanding of these motivations is crucial for public policymakers, who should strive to design payment systems that respond to the needs of all social groups. Therefore, in (at least) the short and medium term, cash will remain in circulation, even if it gradually loses its payment function. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).},

This study employs a modified Technology acceptance Model (TAM) to examine whether perceived values mediate or augment the effect of Islamic digital payments on purchase decisions of MSMEs’ products. Using data gathered from 477 respondents, we find that the perceived values do augment Islamic digital payment effect on Muslim customer purchase decision on MSMEs products. However, their augmentation for the case of cash payments is absent. In other words, Islamic digital payments and perceived values are together the predictors of Muslim customer purchase decision while cash payments are not. We also note that the Islamic digital payments are the predictor of perceived values. © 2024 Bank Indonesia Institute. All rights reserved.},

The e-payment system makes it possible to provide convenience in transactions rather than using cash. In addition to increasing payment efficiency, increasing customer loyalty and further increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of time. This study aims to analyze the effect of e-payment gateways on the performance of MSMEs in the food and beverage sector in Pangkalpinang City. The method used in this study is a quantitative method with a sample of MSME actors in the food and beverage sector in Pangkalpinang City, totaling 100 respondents. The data analysis tool used in this study used SPSS Version 24 with multiple linear regression tests. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that e-payment has a positive and significant effect on the performance of micro, small and medium enterprises because e-payment activities are able to provide convenience for transactions, increase time efficiency and effectiveness, reduce costs required for various payment documents that are done manually. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

Our analytical model incorporates cross-side network externalities at both sides of the platform. We find that the optimal pricing strategy involves cross-subsidization, including subsidizing customers to register for the service while charging the merchants per transaction. Moreover, the technology option adopted by the platform influences this optimal pricing format. In particular, the platform should subsidize customers more if the payment technology imposes larger transaction costs on customers and charge merchants more if banks demand a higher payment processing fee. Our major findings remain qualitatively valid when per-transaction subsidy is available and the marginal benefit of cross-side network externalities diminishes. Finally, the presence of a platform improves social welfare if the per-transaction subsidy sufficiently stimulates consumption on the platform. © Operational Research Society 2023.},

	abstract = {The use of cashless payment instruments has been on an increase over many years now. At the same time, demand for cash has been on the rise as well and we can observe a particularly high level of growth demand for banknotes during crisis times. The increase in demand for cash known as the "banknote paradox"is a phenomenon observed in many economies. It results from the existence of two streams of demand for cash - transactional and precautionary, and the differences in the directions of their changes from the point of view of the central bank and other entities involved in cash transactions, since it enables the optimization of cash supply management, which allows, on the one hand, to reduce the costs of cash processing and, on the other hand, to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. This paper estimates the share of the transaction demand for cash with the aggregate demand. The strength and direction of the impact of selected macroeconomic and behavioural factors (uncertainty caused by the Global Financial Crisis and the Pandemic Crisis) on transaction and precautionary demand for cash were also assessed. A novel approach to the problem of demand for cash is based on considering the impact of macroeconomic shocks in the form of crises on the demand for cash. © 2023 Ilona Skibińska-Fabrowska.},

The suggested system integrates cloud-based services, contactless payment mechanisms, and real-time data processing to improve toll collection. The system's core control unit, a Raspberry Pi board, connects components and connects to the cloud. To identify RFID-tagged vehicles, the toll booth has an RFID reader. The sensor module detects vehicles and activates the cameras to record real-time video of vehicles passing through toll-collecting stations. An LCD screen to display the unit can be included for displaying details to the toll booth manager and showing transaction data to the user. Cloud integration securely transmits, and stores collected data and vehicle information in a centralized database for processing. This allows real-time toll transaction monitoring, automated toll charge calculations, and a seamless payment gateway connection. The capacity, high availability, and trustworthy data storage enable effective toll transaction processing in the cloud. Contactless payment technologies, such as mobile payment applications or electronic wallets, allow customers to pay without cash or toll tags. This optimizes user convenience and supports a seamless and safe toll-collecting procedure. Payment integration ensures accuracy and reduces human mistakes by making transactions smooth and safe.

	abstract = {The process of digitisation in the financial sector is developing through the systematic introduction of computer systems, the establishment of Internet connectivity and the use and ownership of various information and communication devices. Information and communication technologies can increase the desired degree of financial inclusion in a country by increasing the availability of various financial services. This study examines the individual attributes that can affect financial inclusion in the Euro Area countries in 2021. Our analysis applies a probit model to data from the World Bank Global Findex database, focusing on digital payments as a proxy for financial inclusion. The main finding highlights that higher income, higher education, female gender, and younger age groups are associated with an increased propensity to engage in digital payments. Notably, our expectation of a non-linear relationship between age and digital payments is confirmed, as evidenced by the application of the Robin Hood algorithm. Specifically, we observe a positive correlation between age and digital payment usage. However, this trend reverses beyond a specific breakpoint, approximately around the age of 40, leading to a subsequent decline in digital payment activity. Furthermore, our research shows that individuals who utilised alternative payment methods alongside cash before the COVID-19 pandemic are likelier to engage in higher digital payments. Additionally, a tendency for higher adoption of digital payments coincides with countries that achieved a higher Digital Access Index (DAI), an indicator assessing the degree of digitalisation in a country. Furthermore, it is associated with countries among the Euro Area’s founding members. © 2024, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC) technology for contactless payments has emerged as a solution in contemporary commerce, facilitating seamless transactions through its short-range, high-frequency wireless communication capabilities. Embedded within the broader framework of Radio-frequency identification (RFID), NFC has widespread adoption across various domains, including retail point-of-sale systems, and public transportation fare systems. Within the context of shuttle services in Ghana, the current cash centric fare collection system results in delays, financial losses and health concerns particularly during pandemics. Mitigating these challenges requires payment interventions that are resilient against contagion risks and operational inefficiencies. This research integrates NFC enabled ID cards into the University of Ghana shuttle infrastructure for fare payments and facilitates self-funding of cards via a mobile application with diverse financial channels. A robust server-side application governs user data and transactional integrity, and a mobile and web-based administrative portal for streamlined oversight and management of the system. By integrating contactless payment technology into the shuttle system, both passengers and shuttle managers stand to benefit from improved operational efficiency and enhanced user experience.  © 2024 IEEE.},

This approach not only benefits the decentralized, immutable, and transparent as a nature of blockchain-supported technology but also protects the sensitive info with the added security layer of RSA encryption. The NFTs usages ensure the uniqueness and irreplaceability of each transaction, thereby offering a system that is secure, private, and efficient compared to the central-based storage in the current system.

The revolution in communication and technology has motivated the youth to perform digital payment transactions through smartphones. However, the youth’s intention to continue the use of smartphone-based payment services (SBPS) is determined by various factors. Customer satisfaction is one of the important factors as it sustains the use of any product or innovation. Therefore, the present study intends to analyse the mediating effect of satisfaction on the relationship between continuance intention to use SBPS and its determinants. Primary data collected from 683 young SBPS users were analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings revealed that satisfaction positively mediates the relationship between trust, confirmation, social influence, facilitating conditions, habit and continuance intention to use SBPS. As customer satisfaction positively influences the continuance intention to use SBPS, the service providers must ensure their customers’ satisfaction for long-term survival in the ever-changing market environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of financial technology (Fintech), financial services are becoming an integral part of our lives. We are gradually transitioning from a cash-based payment system to a digital payment system. However, this shift has been limited by people’s intentions. Drawing on the expectation confirmation model and the electronic service quality model, this paper investigates the continuance intention (CI) of mobile banking (MB) as a Fintech product. The study employed a cross-sectional survey research design and purposive sampling technique to collect data from 301 MB users. Data analysis was conducted using partial least square structural equation modeling and artificial neural network techniques. The results indicate that confirmation significantly influences perceived usefulness (PU) and satisfaction. Additionally, mobile banking service quality (MB-SQ) significantly impacts both confirmation and satisfaction, while PU and satisfaction significantly influence CI. Mediational analysis revealed that confirmation partially mediates the relationship between MB-SQ and satisfaction. These findings could encourage Fintech service providers and researchers to focus on MB-SQ as a critical variable for promoting continued usage. MB service providers could gain insights into designing strategies to enhance service quality and attract more customers. To the best of researchers’ knowledge, this paper is among the earliest to incorporate MB-SQ into the existing expectation confirmation model. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

However, its collection efficiency has continued to plummet in the last three years. There was a 19% decrease from 2018 to 2019, 47% from 2019 to 2020, and 20% by the end of the second quarter of 2021. When the pandemic happened, there was a sudden drop of 54% in the LLP collection rate. The researchers formulated a workable solution to improve the collection efficiency and investment recovery of the LLP. Oyelami et al. (2020) [1] study revealed a significant positive relationship between the electronic payment systems determinants and e-payment adoption. Around 60% of the respondents agreed that they are willing to adapt to e-payment schemes because of convenience, security and safety, and social influences. However, the results from their estimations also show that factors such as educational attainment, financial inclusion, income level, internet service availability, and other financial infrastructures are critical determinants of e-payment adoption. This paper on digital technology for collection efficiency and investment recovery highly recommends the shift to digital payments. The study revealed that 68% of the lot awardees prefer sending SMS billing reminders to receive a printed account statement. Furthermore, 77% of the respondents in this study have shown a strong interest in paying electronically through the "E-Cash"online payment platform, while 12% prefer other online modes. Therefore, the shift to online payments is desired.  © 2022 ACM.},

It would simply reflect the popular physical currency in digital form. The 'digital rupee,' as it will be known, would be issued in digital form by the Reserve Bank as well as will be exchangeable with physical currency. India's push toward digital payment options were altered in 2016 when the demonetisation of money occurred. Although it was a difficult decision for a country where 90% of transactions are made in cash, people quickly adopted digital payment methods in India. The proliferation of smartphones and the availability of user-friendly payment options such as PAYTM and BHIM UPI have aided the adoption of digital payment systems. The objective of the research aims in gaining a better understanding of central bank digital currency (CBDC) among the public. The qualitative research method used books, journals, newspapers, and websites as data sources. The study highlights advancements in digital money transactions, elements of CBDC, a new threshold for CBDC, a distinction between digital currencies and cryptocurrencies, and challenges for CBDC.

The findings from in-depth interviews articulated six major concerns while using MP at home, namely perceived risks, costs, incompatibility, complexity, customer support, and social influence. Three major concerns for not using MP when travelling abroad include perceived security risk, costs, and incompatibility. Discontinuity of usage include past experiences and concerns about using MP in the home country, together with their negative evaluation of the MP service environment of the travel destinations. This study answers why some Chinese tourists abandon MP when they travel. Practical implications are offered to service providers to enhance users’ experiences. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Considering also that during the Covid 19 pandemic the government advised the public to reduce physical contact in order to inhibit the spread of Covid 19, this had an impact on changes in people’s behavior in making transactions. ShopeePay is an electronic wallet (E Wallet) that is often used by various groups in Indonesia because it is easy, safe and satisfying. Currently, this E Wallet is present in more than 500 cities and districts in Indonesia and will continue to expand its acceptance so that it can reach more users. The method used in this research is quantitative research methods with descriptive research type. The population used in this research is students who live in South Tangerang and use E Wallet with a sample size of 400 respondents. The analysis techniques that will be used are the classical assumption test and multiple regression analysis. Based on the results of research using descriptive analysis with the help of SPSS for Windows software, it shows that digital marketing, brand trust, have a significant simultaneous and partial influence on the decision to use E Wallet. © 2024 SPIE.},

Using the Unified Theory of adoption and Use of Technology, or UTAUT paradigm, this study seeks to ascertain the adoption of e-wallets in Indonesia as well as the factors influencing their use. The purpose of this study is to ascertain how utilizing an e-wallet affects an individual's behavioral intention. The survey uses a quantitative methodology and has 382 respondents who are spread throughout different parts of Indonesia. PLS-SEM SmartPLS 3 and IBM SPSS were used to evaluate regression analysis and structural equation modeling on the data. It was discovered that Effort Expectancy, Performance Expectancy, and Social Influence have a major and beneficial impact on behavioral intention. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that perceived risk, perceived cost, perceived trust, and self-efficacy are less reliable indicators of users' behavioral intention and have little bearing on it. This finding suggests that Indonesian e-wallet users behave similarly to those in underdeveloped nations in that they prioritize convenience, functionality, and social impact over aspects like risk, trust, and security. © 2024 IEEE.},

Some people prefer to use the old payment method (cash), and it is affected by several factors. This research seeks to determine how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived security affect users' preference of utilizing QRIS. For purposes of assessing its objective, quantitative approach was employed. The survey was distributed to the public that had experience using QRIS. SmartPLS 4 was used to assess 191 responses for model and structural metrics. As in result, effort expectancy and performance expectancy were not crucial to the respondents when adopting QRIS payment.

	abstract = {This study addresses the changes in the use of non-cash payments by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of individual banks in Poland. In hypothesis H1 we assumed that during the pandemic there was a change in the payment behaviour towards an increased use of mobile payments. In order to verify H1, we calculated the average values of the indicators characterising non-cash payments for each first quarter in 2019–2022. In hypothesis H2 we assumed that in each period it is possible to distinguish a group of banks whose clients actively used mobile payments (H2a) and a group of banks whose clients more often used traditional forms of non-cash payments (H2b). To verify H2, we used the farthest-neighbour clustering method. The general findings of the research show that the payment behaviour of banks’ clients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic differed. This resulted in a change in the position of some banks on the non-cash payments market in Poland. © 2023 Narodowy Bank Polski. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mobile payment systems in developing economies face challenges in adoption and engagement, owing to infrastructural constraints, cultural affinity towards cash, and limited financial literacy. This study delves into the role of user-perceived co-production equity, which is a sense of fairness and influence in service development, in shaping user behaviour in mobile payment systems. We conducted the study on 436 mobile payment users through online and offline surveys, applying PROCESS and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses. The findings of this study underscore the importance of a fair co-production process, which positively influences service recommendations, resilience to disruptions, and sustained usage over time. User relationship satisfaction partially mediates these relationships, whereas service credibility strengthens them. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis confirms that co-production equity is a necessary condition for user advocacy and continuance intention. We propose a strategic framework for service providers and policymakers, advocating for a shift towards genuine user co-production characterised by transparency, robust feedback mechanisms, and community engagement initiatives. This user-centric approach not only fosters trust and drives adoption but also significantly mitigates churn rates, navigates cultural barriers, and fosters sustained user engagement, thereby advancing financial inclusion in developing countries. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In today's digital age, technology has become integral to everyday life, including the financial sector. This study explores the implementation of a smart card payment system for primary school students, utilizing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to enhance convenience, financial education, administrative efficiency, and parental involvement. The current reliance on cash transactions in schools presents several issues: students risk losing cash, and parents lack effective mechanisms to monitor their child's spending and dietary choices. The primary objectives of this study are to eliminate the need for cash transactions and to provide a system that allows parents to monitor their child's spending habits at school. The proposed solution involves developing a smart card payment system that enables students to make purchases quickly and securely using RFID smart cards, with parents having the ability to track and manage their child's spending through an online portal. The study employs the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, focusing on iterative development and user feedback to refine the system. Key components include RFID smart cards, card readers, and a secure online platform for monitoring transactions. Results from pilot implementations indicate a high perception of convenience and security among both students and parents. Acceptance rates were notably high, with 85% of parents and 90% of students expressing satisfaction with the system. The smart card payment system promotes financial responsibility among students and provides transparency and control for parents. It also enhances operational efficiency within schools by streamlining payment processes and reducing the risks associated with handling cash. This study highlights the technical specifications, security measures, and empirical results, demonstrating the system's effectiveness and addressing potential challenges. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The correct approach to liquidity risk management in banks is essential for securing their financial stability. The position of liquidity risk among the rest of bank risks is specific because the negative outcome is not just a loss, but directly the bankruptcy of the institution. Such an occurrence might start a chain reaction and bring uncertainty into the entire financial system. This paper focused on one source of liquidity risk, i.e. management of liquidity throughout the day. The management of intraday liquidity is related to cash inflows and outflows occurring during the business day, their timing and settlement. In 2013, the BCBS published the document Monitoring tools for intraday liquidity management, often referred to by the regulatory authorities. It offers basic concepts of intraday liquidity monitoring and sketchily defines stress scenarios. The author suggests possibilities of how to perform intraday liquidity stress testing in a bank, which is often required by supervisors, even though no detailed approach or methodology as to how to proceed was introduced by the regulators. The research was carried out on anonymised data of cash inflows and outflows recorded on a central bank reserves account of one of the Slovak commercial banks. Both a base and four stress scenarios were developed and suggested for the better understanding of expected cashflows in standard conditions and during stress. The author’s aim was to develop scenarios in a non-traditional way by means of a basic and EWMA historical bootstrap simulations, respectively. Stress scenarios are supposed to simulate reputation crisis, disruption in RTGS payment system, increased deposit outflows and bank run. The purpose of the proposed intraday liquidity monitoring scenarios was to strengthen resilience not only for a concrete bank, but also the entire financial system. Intraday liquidity monitoring is a key factor in securing stability of the financial sector. © 2023 Mária Vojtková, Patrik Mihalech.},

Projections of banknote returns are informed by three elements: forecasts of personal consumption, the cash share of that spending, and the returns ratio — that is the ratio of (the log of) banknote returns to the (log of) cash-based personal consumption. To illustrate the modelling approach, the study considers the effects of future payment instrument choices and of COVID-19 on consumption to forecast cash returns for Ireland up to 2030. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

	abstract = {Since e-Cash and electronic transactions consist of digital data, there are risks that this data can be easily falsified, compromising the security and efficiency of the entire electronic payment protocol. To ensure the security of the protocol, these data must be protected. This is why researchers have focused on several cryptographic studies including secret sharing. Secret sharing techniques are used to divide a secret into multiple shares and to distribute them among a group of participants. Only when a sufficient number of shares are combined together, the original secret can be reconstructed. Moreover, no information about the secret can be deducted from the shares by a smaller group. In this paper, we investigate the different phases of an electronic payment protocol where secret sharing can be used and more particularly distributed key generation and distributed multikey generation protocols. This paper also highlights the importance of using secret sharing in enhancing the security and confidentiality of electronic payment systems, as well as the ability to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

	abstract = {Physical cash enables payments in the absence of electricity or network coverage. Such offline payment functionality promotes the operational resilience and, particularly in developing countries, the accessibility of payments. Central banks are exploring issuing digital cash substitutes with similar offline payment functionality. Such substitutes could incorporate novel features, making them more desirable than physical cash. This paper considers automating personal loss recovery for offline digital currency balances through the introduction of an expiry date. Our results show this functionality could have a substantial positive impact on consumer demand for offline digital currency balances. We find an asymmetric impact on welfare of adjustments to the expiry date: small increases from the optimum cause little damage, but small decreases from the optimal expiry date can have a large negative impact. More information-sharing between user devices and the central bank can improve loss recovery but has an ambiguous impact on social welfare. © 2024 The Author(s).

This mobile-based payment model is a payment method that offers convenience, efficiency, effectiveness, compatibility, and convenience. However, mobile payments come with significant risks, considering they are electronic and wireless. Therefore, authentication is required in payments. Even though the technological requirements for secure mobile payments have been met according to standards, there are still security gaps that unauthorized persons can penetrate. Therefore, this paper proposes an anonymous authentication and management flow for mobile payments to support transaction security, prevent user information disclosure, and reduce identity theft.

	abstract = {a b s t RaCt Along with the rapid growth of technology, payment instruments are also changing. Electronic money is slowly but surely replacing the role of paper money and coins. The emergence of electronic money can provide convenience for consumers, it can lead to an increase in the demand for goods and services that ultimately leads to demand-pull inflation. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of electronic money transactions (both in natural and in value terms) on inflation growth. By using the Chow Breakpoint Test, Difference-in-Differences and Propensity Score Matching shows that the inflation trend has tended to decline since the Bank of Indonesia launched its national non-cash campaign. By using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method was revealed that an increase in the volume of electronic money transactions in the long-term may affect a decrease in inflation, but not in the short-term. The rate of interest of the Bank of Indonesia, the growth of lending and GDP led to the decline in inflation. It was concluded that the Bank of Indonesia could expand the use of electronic money to manipulate inflation levels in the long-term. The policy that can be implemented by Bank Indonesia is to distribute electronic money infrastructure services more evenly and increase the socialization of the use of electronic money, especially in remote areas. © Fadli F., Devia V., 2023},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital currencies (CBDCs) are one of the most important trends of the late 2010s, which can radically change the role of financial regulators in the financial services industry. The purpose of the study is to identify the distinctive characteristics of the central bank’s digital currencies in comparison with other forms of money and determine the possible impact of them on the economy of a country. The study reveals the process underlying blockchain transactions and the main risks of cryptocurrencies such as high volatility, anonymity of transactions contributing to the development of illegal activities, a threat to the welfare of citizens and the financial stability of the economy. At the same time, the introduction of CBDCs potentially promises to significantly reshape payment infrastructure at both the domestic and international levels. We define a central bank digital currency as central bank money in a digital form that will be used along with cash and non-cash money, performing all the functions of money and being equivalent to all three forms of the same currency (1 digital ruble = 1 ruble in cash = 1 non-cash ruble on the deposit accounts). During the research 14 core features of CBDCs have been identified, covering the CBDC instrument, the underlying system, and the broader institutional framework in which they exist. On the Russian market the question of issuing a digital ruble becomes particularly relevant as the share of non-cash trade turnover in total consumer spending is constantly growing. In the course of the study, the authors identified the main factors that can assess the degree of readiness of businesses and citizens to implement digital ruble, according to which it can be recognized that there is a high potential for the adoption of innovative financial technologies in Russia. It is worth noting that in February 2022, the Bank of Russia started assessing the possibility of issuing a digital ruble and conducting tests. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {[Purpose] The purpose of the study is to conduct legal analysis on the legal regulation problems concerning the concept of "electronic money" and the development of the modern monetary system of Kazakhstan based on the digitalisation of certain processes in the modern state. [Methodology/approach/design] Based on the legal and general scientific research methods, an analysis of the existing legal framework and other documents in the studied area was carried out. Also, a comparative-structural analysis of individual norms of legal acts of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries was made. [Findings] The issues of legal regulation and the incorporation of various concepts related to electronic money circulation into the laws of individual countries were examined based on the focus of the study. The idea of introducing a single digital electronic currency into Kazakhstan's national payment system, which would be backed by government finances and the obligations of the country's National Bank, was also substantiated. The arguments in support of this initiative by Kazakhstan's "main" bank and the country's government to launch a pilot process for the introduction of the digital tenge were formulated. This process will operate in circulation along with other cash and non-cash fiat currencies. In this regard, the chosen subject of the study is certainly promising for further scientific and theoretical deepening. This includes a further study of the prospects of digitalisation of the country's monetary system. Furthermore, a legal approach to the issue has revealed particular shortcomings in the enshrining of certain terms in Kazakhstan's legislation. © 2023 Universidade de Brasilia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article analyses possibility of expanding an international usage of Russian currency in the circumstances of unprecedented sanctions, which were imposed with the purpose to break Russia’s external trade relations and to isolate this country from the global financial system. Author comes to conclusion that dominance of the non-cash money in the international transactions has resulted in the full dependence of all modern currencies on specially created settlement systems. Nowadays currencies can circulate internationally only within such systems. Therefore any national currency is exposed to potential restrictions by the country, which issues dominant global currency (i.e. the US Dollar). This fact makes it very difficult to expand internationalisation of the Rouble by traditional methods. In the modern circumstances the key prerequisite of such expansion is existence of the Rouble settlement and payment systems, which can operate independently of the foreign ones. Such systems were created well before 2022 and technically can facilitate transactions with the Rouble worldwide. However, the problem is that potential foreign counterparts are very cautious to work with any Russian systems due to a risk of the secondary sanctions by the USA. Also widely publicised the Russian government requirement that European importers must pay for Russian gas in Roubles did not help to widen internationalization of Russian currency, as this was Rouble payment in name only, but not in truth. To solve this problem it is suggested to use combined methods: i.e. to extend independent Russian settlement & payment infrastructure worldwide through formal and informal agreements; to broaden the usage of non-cash money and quasi-money; to issue financial instruments, which can circulate worldwide, but outside the settlement infrastructure, which is controlled by the western countries. © 2023 Alexander P.

	abstract = {In today's fast, advanced and tech-oriented world, human life has been simplified and upgraded at a much higher level which with time will increase with a great spectrum. According to the report, the smart card market is projected to experience a growth rate (CAGR) of 7.33% by 2033. Payment systems have evolved a lot with time and from which we are about to discuss security payment transactions using smart cards. A smart card is a card with a chip comprising CPU, RAM and ROM for storage purposes. This concept of using a plastic card with an embedded chip was first patented in 1968 by two German inventors, Jurgen Dethloff and Helmut Grottrup. Motorola and Bull developed the first smart card microchips in 1977. Due to its ability to provide more secured and authenticated transaction smart cards are fit for use in contactless payments as compared to barcodes or machine-readable stripes. Smart cards find utility in scenarios demanding heightened authentication and security in contrast to alternative machine-readable data stores such as barcodes and magnetic stripes. The first is passwords, confidential and public cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption etc. It performs personal identification by collecting such personal information. This involves biometric information like fingerprint scans, iris scans and images. The second is digital currency. Electronic cash is debited at the time of purchase and the cardholder must pay 'real' money to complete it. Personal information (excluding personal information), such as purchase information at certain stores, medical history and travel history. One of the most crucial factors in the success of smart cards is that they are secure, transferable and can maintain data integrity and then data is stored on the card. In this article we will examine the security of contactless payment systems, considering personal threats and different attacks which the system must protect against. Our review focused on the importance of trust, security measures and technologies that govern how transactions occur in contactless payment cards and NFC-enabled mobile wallets. We will also investigate EMV and ISO standards for contactless payment and highlight their limitations in improving the security and privacy of contactless payments. These conflicts are problematic because adversaries can use them to weaken the integrity of free connections  © 2024 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.},

However, some issues need to be resolved with electronic financial systems, which are generally managed by commercial organizations. These drawbacks include internet connectivity, astronomical fees for utilizing the system, and security issues. Many nations throughout the world are contemplating central-bank digital currency (CBDC) as a remedy. Offline peer-to-peer (P2P) payments have emerged as a viable solution for secure and convenient financial transactions that do not require an Internet connection. This research paper examines the need for offline peer-to-peer payments, the system's logical architecture, including its fundamental building elements, its primary use cases, and the difficulties involved in putting it into practice. Several cutting-edge methods and tools that help to overcome the issues associated with offline payments are discussed. These include the use of secure cryptographic protocols, tokenization, and the adoption of near-field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth technologies for device-to-device communication. By examining the key components of offline P2P payments, this study aims to provide insights and recommendations for advancing offline P2P payment systems. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is causing once-in-a-century upheavals in global civilization. Payment systems have advanced lately, from simple cash or credit card transactions to various forms of mobile payment systems. This transformation is occurred due to COVID 19 and shifts in the economy, the growth of social networks, technical advancements on the Internet, and the increased usage of mobile devices. Throughout COVID19, this article offers a unique approach to the payment scheduling issue, which seeks out a timetable that enhances the project's stakeholders' benefit. Both the sponsor and the contractor in a project want to have a strong payment plan on their own. To create an equal schedule between the sponsor and the development team, the timing of payments and the completion periods of project activities are decided concurrently. The Harris hawks optimization method is designed to tackle the problem because of its high NP-hardness. Harris hawks optimization is a novel meta-heuristic nature-inspired optimizer inspired by how Harris hawks hunt food in nature. By comparing the suggested Harris hawks optimization optimizer to existing nature-inspired methods, the efficacy of the suggested Harris hawks optimization optimizer is determined. The Harris hawks optimization algorithm appears to be highly promising based on the statistical findings and comparisons. The MATLAB simulator's simulation findings confirm the algorithm's superiority over earlier efforts regarding energy, cost, delay time, and net value. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Digitalization has some inherent advantages like speed, freedom from carrying cash around oneself, and transparency in monetary transactions, and serves as a blessing in disguise in many ways. It has also been cited as an important growth driver of an economy. The main digital payment systems include Immediate Payment Service, Real Time Gross Settlement, Electronic Fund Transfer, National Automated Clearing House, Unified Payments Interface, and many more. In the Indian context, digitalization picked up a pace post-demonetization. In fact, the financial stroke of the government to contain black money actually proved a boon for digitalization. The current study is an attempt to empirically gauge the impact of digital payments on the GDP of the Indian economy. Regression analysis has been used to study the same.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Technology keeps evolving, offering opportunities to the private sector to develop new products and systems to exchange funds or value (i.e. crypto assets). In the quest to exploit technological advancement and keep up with an increasing digitized financial market, central banks have been exploring the possibility to issue a digital form of the traditional fiat currency (so-called central bank digital currency - "CBDC"). As CBDC projects are progressing and shaping up, a host of legal and regulatory questions arise. This article aims to examine the regulatory implications of CBDCs vis-à-vis the European Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulatory framework. It explores the recent developments of the European AML regulatory framework spurred by financial innovation and technology, taking into account both the current (i.e. Directive 2018/843/EU ("AMLD4"), as amended by Directive 2015/849/EU ("AMLD5") and upcoming (i.e. Regulation (EU) 2024/1624 - the "AMLR") legislation. It emphasizes the coordination between the EU AML legislation with the new substantive EU regime on crypto assets (the "MiCAR") as well as with the new "payment services package"(the European Commission proposal for a "PSD3"and "PSR"). The analysis delves into the European Commission Proposal for a regulation on the establishment of the Digital Euro, adopting a functional approach that explains the diversified AML treatment of the "offline"(bearer-based) and "online"use (account-based) of the digital euro. In so doing, the article examines the legal characterization of "cash"for AML purposes and the potential consequences for the Digital Euro.  © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Technological progress is causing the appearance of new property that, like traditional ones, can be material objects of the crime of money laundering, the same can be said of the new ways in which legal documents or instruments can be represented and that prove their ownership. Directive 2018/1673 only includes the generic definition of property, but others define, for example, electronic money, virtual currency, non-cash payment instrument and expressly regulate trust or other similar ones. One of these terms has been transposed into the Criminal Code, but we consider it positive that the legislator has not done the same with the rest. The speed of technological changes makes it difficult to determine them precisely and an ex ante definition could only be provided because it is most likely that when it is finished being developed, other peculiarities will appear that make it impossible to include it in that definition, forcing it to be modified to avoid punishability gaps. The question that this work aims to answer is whether they can be considered as suitable property to become the material object of a money laundering crime. After an exhaustive analysis the answer is yes. Whatever their nature, as long as they represent an economic advantage derived from the commission of a previous criminal activity and are susceptible to incorporation into assets and the lawful trafficking of property. © 2023 Jesus Barquin Universidad de Granada.

	abstract = {All transactions between buyers and sellers and businesses are done using payment systems. In the past, people made payments using traditional means such as cash and checks. However, due to advanced technology, e-commerce, the internet, and mobile devices, payment systems have transformed from cash-based to digital-based transactions. Mobile payment refers to modern payment practices via mobile devices such as cellphones, smartphones, or tablets. Mobile payment allows consumers to reduce the use of cash and offers efficient and fast performance as well as the secure transfer of information between consumers when conducting payments and transactions. Even though mobile payment provides these benefits, non-cash payment practices are still new among most consumers in Cambodia due to limited knowledge of digital-based payment. Some companies succeeded, while some failed due to limited insights into the success factors that predict users’ intention to use mobile payment. Therefore, the researchers decided to conduct this study by extending TAM with trust, innovativeness, and functionality, aiming to explore the user’s acceptance of mobile payment services. This study was conducted on 301 respondents who have experiences of using mobile payment applications. The collected data was analyzed using the Statistical Packages of SPSS 25 and AMOS 23. Based on the results, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive effect on behavioral intention to use mobile payment services. Perceived usefulness is positively predicted by perceived ease of use, innovativeness, and functionality. Trust and innovativeness positively influence perceived ease of use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is an emerging trend in digital payments, with the vast majority of central banks around the world researching, piloting, or even operating a digital version of cash. While design choices differ broadly, such as accounts vs. tokens, the wallets are generally protected through cryptographic algorithms that safeguard against double spending and ensure non-repudiation. With the advent of quantum computing, these algorithms are threatened by new attack vectors. To better understand those threats, we conducted a study of typical assets in a CBDC system, describe which ones are most amenable to post-quantum cryptography, and propose an upgrade strategy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

While most of the recent activity (papers, pilots, etc) in the field of central bank digital currency (CBDC) has focused on the potential advantages for central banks and on the technology (ledgers, platforms, etc), a more appropriate starting point is to identify what problems CBDC is intended to solve, especially for the affected stakeholders. At the end of the evaluation, focus on technological solutions should commence only once business and policy goals have been iden-tified. After a quick summary of the motivations for central banks, regulators, governments and pol-icymakers, the paper examines the motivations for the other key stakeholders in the ecosystem — an aspect that has to date been insufficiently examined. The paper then comments on the challenges asso-ciated with driving consumer adoption of CBDC, before discussing the microeconomic disincentives for CBDC adoption among commercial banks, along-side the macroeconomic necessity.The paper concludes with some thoughts on how to balance the conflicting interest of the many stakeholders and the lessons one can learn from other large-scale payment initiatives. © 2023, Henry Stewart Publications.

More recently, the pandemic has also accelerated the digitalisation of payments and changed the general view of e-payment systems, not only in the EU but around the world. Consumers fear the risk of virus transmission and government directives to increase the number of non-cash payments have together resulted in a decrease in the amount of cash as a form of payment. At the same time, commercial entities in the private sector proceeded to issue new types of private digital currencies; stablecoins, in addition to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The decline of cash and the rise of new private digital currencies has pushed public authorities, especially central banks, to look for other alternatives, such as issuing new public central digital currencies. In order to increase the supply of payment services and provide the public with a different money delivery option as a result of changing payment habits, central banks around the world believe that issuing a central bank digital currency is increasingly likely. Like other regions, the Eurozone is no exception in terms of launching and testing its digital currency, the digital euro. The main concern is whether the Eurozone is ready to use this type of currency – whether technically or legally – and whether the digital euro will be used by consumers as the next form of payment. © 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem.

And yet, little attention has been paid to the European Central Bank (ECB)'s accountability in the process of adoption and beyond. This article attempts to fill this void. It argues that the concept of ‘independent accountability’, still prevalent regarding monetary policy, is an inappropriate standard to hold the ECB accountable for its decisions on the digital euro for at least three reasons. First, while the ECB has the power to issue a digital euro with cash-like features, its mandate is not clear-cut, nor are its decisions merely technical in nature. Second, the digital euro affects areas in which the ECB has no specific expertise or authority, such as privacy, and its adoption requires an unprecedented level of coordination with the EU legislators. And third, it is not only public authorities with which the ECB must engage, but also market actors and citizens to ensure the digital euro's success. What emerges is a new accountability standard, with a broader range of ‘accountability stakeholders’ and a stronger role for ex ante consultations. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {With the rise of digitalisation, payment habits and solutions have undergone a significant transformation, which is also driven by generational differences. Our study aims to explore how the payment preferences and habits of each generation differ in the digital space. Older generations tend to prefer more conservative payment methods, such as credit cards or cash, while younger generations are more open to modern, innovative solutions such as mobile payments and cryptocurrencies. Our paper highlights the extent to which technological developments and digital literacy are influencing the payment habits of different generations, and how the role of security and convenience is shaping the payment choices of different age groups. The study focuses on the financial literacy of each generation, including how to navigate 21st century finance. It is no exaggeration to say that not everyone has the same knowledge or understanding of modern finance. However, effective financial decision-making requires not only an understanding of traditional finance, but also the ability to keep abreast of the financial changes of the modern age. This study will hopefully shed light on the importance of the subject and the importance of developing financial literacy. We can strongly assume that financial literacy can be characterised at very different levels when looking at different generations, so it seems worthwhile to look more closely at the level of financial literacy among different generations. However, the present study focuses on financial habits and solutions. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.},

However, this is not the prevailing situation in Indonesia, where currency is widely used across the archipelago. In recent decades, the need for cash in circulation has risen steadily, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, the possible economic ramifications of rejecting coins in circulation render the ongoing discussion a significant concern. Therefore, this research thoroughly examined the existence of Rupiah coins in terms of their buying power, denominational structure, and comparative analysis with other countries. The analysis of denomination structure concerning the present and future inflation rate, represented by the average of minimum wages, was conducted utilizing the D-Metric and a univariate regression. A cross-country comparative analysis was performed using a global product index, and the denomination structure of the Rupiah coin was compared to the denomination structures in several ASEAN countries and other nations. The research findings indicate that the denomination structure of Rupiah coins has been unsuitable for the current economic situation since 2013. The results are of great importance, as they support policies that improve the usefulness of Rupiah coins for economic transactions and reduce production costs. © 2024 Bina Nusantara University.

The factors determining the strategic importance of the payment card market for stimulating the economy and the standard of living of society are substantiated. The current trends in the development of the financial market in Ukraine have been determined, which indicate that payment cards as a key tool for remote access to bank accounts are the main driver of the development of cashless payment operations and the promotion of the institutional foundations of money circulation in the direction of the increasing growth of its cashless component, which reflects society's demand for reduction in price, acceleration and improvement of payments. Global processes of building economic relations based on digital transformation make this trend irreversible. The dynamics of the main quantitative parameters of the functioning of the payment card market in Ukraine over the past five years have been analyzed, which indicates its active qualitative development and the presence of stable growth trends. At the same time, despite the fact that with the development of information technologies, banks introduce new services and forms of service using payment cards, the article also notes certain problems of the further development of this market, which is connected with the still existing competitive advantages of using cash, and as well as certain institutional difficulties in the functioning of the banking sector. © 2022, Fintech Aliance LLC.

	abstract = {Using all types of mobile devices and wireless communications technologies, mobile payment is a new way to pay for goods and services. This new method, mobile devices can be used to create various types of small payments. This device helps users to connect to the server where the transaction is done and confirmed. Although the government has launched GNNT but still many Indonesian people who use cash. One of GNNT is make payment using smartphone or so-called mobile payment. Despite the advantages of using mobile payment systems, there has not yet been a high adoption rate. This is also reflected using electronic or mobile money in the absence of available payment method alternatives, thus raising the question of what factors affect the people of Indonesia in using mobile payment. In addition, more specific factors of any individual from the people of Indonesia to be able to use mobile payment. Therefore, this study aims to determine the elements that affect interest in using mobile payments. This study is quantitative and used an online questionnaire to collect data. SEM-PLS Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and SmartPLS tools were used to analyze the findings. According to study, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, which are closely tied to personal factors like M-Payment knowledge, compatibility, and trust, influence someone's interest in using mobile payments. © 2023 IEEE.},

Consumer behaviour of electronic payment methods is operationalised using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), checked for validity and reliability, and then tested for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Data is collected from 467 users of electronic payment methods. CFA confirms five-factor structure of consumer behaviour of electronic payment methods as, facilitating conditions, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, perceived security, and behavioural intention. The SEM methodology suggests payment facilitating conditions and payment system performance expectancy lead to consumer’s effort expectancy, and effort expectancy and consumer perceived security lead to consumer behaviour towards electronics payment method. Customer convenience ecosystem can resolve the challenge of cash transactions by integrating electronic payment systems. The research is significant considering recent consumer shift towards electronics payment methods as an alternative to cash transaction. Copyright © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Electronic cash (e-cash) systems need to satisfy the property of anonymity, unforgeability, and transparency which prevent criminal activities from abuse of anonymity. Observers proposed by Chaum et al. and Brands in the ’90 s are one of the cleverest solutions, where observers deployed by the authorities to the user’s device only engage in legitimate anonymous payments, but never cooperate with illegal activities. In other words, observers enforce payers’ legitimate behavior while the cryptographic protocols ensure the observers do not obtain private information about individual payments. However, ever-proposed observers only prevent double-spending as legitimate behavior. There had been no contributions to extend the role of observers from only double-spend prevention to general transparency enforcement required by society without sacrificing privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of open-source observers which can potentially achieve both cryptographic anonymity and highly flexible transparency at the same time. In our setting, observers are published in the cloud as open-source programs and executed within a tamper-proof device with an anonymous attested execution capability, in which all outputs of the execution, with the hash value of the executed open-source program, are signed by the secure processor as formulated by Pass et al. recently. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we first defined the concept of the open-source observers and (2) we showed a construction of Brands’ type provably-secure offline electronic cash scheme with observers extending the scheme by Baldimtsi and Lysyanskaya. © 2024, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

Tech-savvy urbanites buy coffee by tapping their phone on a reader. Parents returning from a night out use peer-to-peer payment apps, such as Venmo, to pay the sitter. The recent explosion of financial innovations promises faster, more efficient, and cheaper transactions. These increasing digital payment options coincide with decreased number and volume of cash transactions. However, vulnerable populations face more constrained payment choices and often rely exclusively on cash. Without experience, devices, or acceptable credit histories, vulnerable populations may have little access to digital transactions. The advantages of falling digital costs and other benefits thus accrue to the digitally connected. At the same time, those who must transact in coins and paper money are likely to find their relative costs increasing. This paper highlights payment trends and the potential impact on vulnerable populations in the United States as we move toward a cashless society. This paper should stimulate discussions of public policy initiatives to mitigate digital payment issues for vulnerable people. © 2023 Albert P.

In addition to keeping distance, wearing masks, gloves and using disinfectant fluids, buyers were asked to forgo paying for the purchases with cash and use payment cards or mobile devices. The purpose of this paper is to identify similarities and differences in payments for grocery purchases in stationary retail shops during the COVID-19 pandemic by two consumer age cohorts, generations X and Y (Millennials). To compare the payment behaviour of the two generations, a CAWI survey was conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey sample consisted of 650 individuals. Based on the variables for the three forms of payment (cash, payment cards and mobile payments), that buyers made in five types of shops (discount, supermarket, hypermarket, convenience shop and branch shops such as bakery and retail vegetable/fruit supply), a cluster analysis (Ward's method) was conducted. Four types of consumers were identified in each generation. The following similarities were found in payment behaviour in stationary retail outlets: In both generations, consumers most often pay for purchases by card and in each of them, a group using this form of payment almost exclusively can be distinguished. In contrast to Generation Y, otherwise known as the Millennials, Generation X includes customers who most often pay for the purchases in cash. Among Millennials, on the other hand, it is possible to identify consumers who prefer to use mobile payments and occasionally pay in cash. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {As Nigeria's economy continues to improve, an automated cash advance payment system can be achieved by adopting the automated Cash Advance Payment System (CAPS). The aim is to promote -good Corporate Governance, thereby increasing stakeholders' confidence in the day-to-day activities of the Bank. CAPS is a system designed to assist organizations in managing and administering cash advances to her employers and other related parties. The motivation for this work are challenges faced by the method of processing cash advance manually, which are prone to error or fraud, undue long hours in the computation of cash advance, and poor tracking of employee records. Insider abuse of cash advance and expense mismanagement has been the major contributor to this menace. This paper presents the design of a cash advance payment system that curbs non-repayment and prevents fraud. For this study, the languages of choice for implementation are PHP and MySQL. While PHP takes care of the client frontend, MySQL serves as the backend. Use case diagram was employed. The developed system stores information with ease, allows easy retrieval of cash advance details, eliminates cash advance fraud and generates reports, which can be printed from any date and year as hard copy for management review and audit purpose. The paper recommends that an automated cash advanced system can be deployed to overcome the observed and highlighted problems inherent in manual cash advanced systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Data was collected through interviews with the managers of e-money issuer companies and 18 millennial e-money customers. Using qualitative methods, this research concludes that the strategy for developing e-money is to create innovations that can make it safer for users to meet their daily needs in the post-covid era. Increased promos and cashback at merchants who have collaborated with products issued is also the most favourite development strategy for customers. E-money customers face obstacles faced by e-money customers include safety issues, limited merchants, unstable provider networks, and socio-cultural factors (the habit of using conventional cash payment methods). The challenge that e-money issuers face is competitors of similar products.

The mobile payment involves very complex mechanism and many industries such as financial industry, information industry, telecommunications industry and service industry. Mobile payment has gradually affected consumer life and industry development. Many shops and restaurants have begun to provide related services. However, compared with other countries, Taiwan's mobile payment usage rate is low. In order to promote the development of new technology services, Taiwan government has launched many preferential policies and various promotion activities. The operators have also try to use different cash discount activities to increase usage of mobile payment and improve transaction efficiency. However, the cooperative banks and contracts of each mobile payment vendor are not the same, people may have doubts on mobile payment. How to use the suitable promotion method to influence the consumers' intention and behavior of using mobile payment be seen as an important issue. This study mainly uses a questionnaire survey to understand the transaction behavior of consumers using new technology. And it further explores the impact of promotion mechanism of mobile payment on consumers' intention and attitudes to mobile payment. © 2019 PICMET.},

	abstract = {This work consists in simulating a real time interbank gross payment system (RTGS) through a multi-agent model, to analyze the evolution of the liquidity brought by the banks to the system. In this model, each bank chooses the amount of a daily liquidity on the basis of costs minimization (costs of liquidity and delaying) by taking into account the liquidity brought by other banks. Banks agents' strategies are based on a liquidity game during several payment days where each bank plays against the others. For their adaptability, we integrate into bank agents learning classifier systems. We carry out several simulations to follow the system total liquidity evolution as that of each bank agent with varying costs coefficients. The question to answer is: what are the cash amounts that banks must provide and under what costs of liquidity and delaying, the system avoids the lack of liquidity? We find that liquidity depends on costs coefficients.},

	abstract = {In America, credit cards constitute one of the most important payment systems for consumer transactions. The financial institutions that issue credit cards generate only part of their revenue from interest paid by card holders. Fees charged to merchants who accept credit cards, called interchange fees, make up another important source of income. Credit card issuers use their advantageous market position to impose supracompetitive interchange fees. The simplest response to these conditions would be for merchants to impose a point-of-sale surcharge on credit card transactions. In many jurisdictions, laws that previously would have prohibited this practice have gone off the books. But pressure from the major credit card networks and the inertia of long-standing tradition have conspired to prevent widespread adoption of merchant surcharging. Evidence suggests that instead, merchants have responded by raising price levels to offset at least some of the transaction fees they expect to incur in the near future. Credit card issuers funnel much of the revenue generated by interchange fees into rewards programs for the benefit of their customers. Since consumers who hold credit cards and use them most frequently tend to be wealthier and have higher incomes—on average—than consumers who use mostly or exclusively cash, any increase in overall consumer prices to offset interchange fees creates a regressive wealth transfer. Congress should address this problem by passing legislation that creates an incentive scheme by which merchants will have the requisite motivation to impose surcharges on customers who pay by credit card, subjecting interchange fees to downward pressure as consumers move purchases to less costly payment methods. Such a scheme would constitute a procompetitive regulatory intervention that would ultimately inure card holders to a new status quo, eliminate the regressive wealth transfer in place under the current system, and benefit nearly all consumers—except for the small fraction of card holders who expend tremendous energy to extract maximum value from rewards programs to the detriment of nearly all other consumers. © 2021, School of Law Publications.

	abstract = {Several digital payment systems have been described which attempt to simulate or extend already existing payment mechanisms so as to make them suitable for electronic commerce. Such mechanisms or instruments include cash or coins (e.g., DigiCash, NetCash), checks (e.g., NetCheque), and credit cards (e.g., CyberCash). The anonymity, off-line, and peer-to-peer aspects of some of these systems can introduce security weaknesses and major scalability problems. One approach to security, as taken by the Millicent architecture, is to only allow very low cost transactions. True security, unlike the approach taken by First Virtual, requires clear delineation of the customer and merchant roles. The goal of this paper is to outline an approach which is inexpensive enough to allow for very low value transactions but secure enough to allow for intermediate value transactions, while providing true customer anonymity with respect to merchants and electronic handling of refund requests. Unlike NetBill and the GC Tech GlobelD system, under the default operation of the system the customer in no way authenticates or identifies itself to the merchant, pseudonymously or otherwise. This is an example of the decoupling of tasks used as a basic design principle: Each system component deals directly with only those aspects in its narrowly defined scope of responsibilities, and within this asynchronous system time-consuming or time-varying issues not directly related to the payment flow, such as actual delivery of digital goods, are handled outside of the basic payment flow. After presenting a high-level comparison of our approach to those of two other instant debit systems, GlobelD and NetBill, we give a more detailed explanation of the design criteria and characteristics exhibited by this new approach to on-line payments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

	abstract = {The article discusses the subject of the consumer's gender and factors that affect shopping, and more specifically whether there is a relationship between gender and preferred means of payment in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. I explore the relationship between cash and other payment instruments using the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment exogenously affecting both the payment industry and consumers’ habits. This article sheds more light on changing the payment habits of consumers since the beginning of the pandemic. The purpose of this article is to examine the styles of payment-related decision making and to identify differences and similarities in this regard according to gender. Women are different from men in every activity they perform, and therefore also in shopping styles. Consumer behaviour is an area in which the diversity of behaviour between men and women is very clear. The author conducted an empirical study in the period of January-February 2022 among the students of the University of the Third Age. The study participants were women and men over 55 years of age. The basic research method was the PAPI (Paper and Pencil Interview) method, based on a questionnaire. In the first part of the article, it was attempted to present some theoretical aspects of payment methods by consumers in Poland and in Europe, based on the analysis of literature sources. Then, the gender-dependent differences in consumer behaviour are presented. The next section describes the procedure of empirical research, as well as the most important conclusions of the research. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {A qualitative analysis of observation protocols and audio recordings from 14 crisis response exercises has been conducted revealing eight themes reoccurring in multi-disciplinary team discussions about crisis response to large disruptions to the card payment system. The themes were: Coordinate and collaborate, Payment options, Cash circulation, Fuel and transportation, Security, Inform, communicate and the media, Hoarding and rationing, and Vulnerable groups. The analysis suggest that Swedish society is vulnerable to disruptions in the card payment services, largely due to a low diversity in payment options, the lack of prepared back up solutions for payment, and insufficient cash flows to support a cash only scenario. A longer (several days) disruption in the card payment system will demand coordinating mechanisms for information management, available payment options, and preparedness for rapid establishment of cash flows. Today, these mechanisms do not exist. Simulation exercises with stake-holders are an important mean for increasing awareness about these vulnerabilities and the challenges associated with coping with them. © 2020 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

	abstract = {OVO's mobile payment application is a Micro Payment application that is developing as a means of payment (electronic money) on smartphones. The application is divided into two, namely OVO Cash and OVO Point. OVO Cash can be used for various types of financial transactions, such as payments at various merchant partners, top up, and balance checking. At present, it's easy to make transactions quickly and easily using OVO Cash. OVO Points are loyalty rewards obtained by OVO users when making transactions at various OVO partner merchants. The advantages of the OVO application with the mobile payment application is that the OVO application can make payment transactions for parking rates at the mall. For example, the Lippo mall in the Jakarta area has implemented the first automate self-parking payment system in Indonesia and the parking fee payment is operated in May 2017. This case study aims to find out the receipt of the OVO payment mobile application as a payment for tariffs. parking, in this study uses the UTAUT model as a research method in order to find out whether performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions influence the behavior intention on the OVO mobile payment application. Through regression statistical test analysis as processing data obtained from questionnaires with the number of 100 respondents using the OVO mobile payment application as a payment tool for parking rates. The data collection technique carried out is a non-probability approach that is using purposive sampling.

The paper concludes with the observation that a FedCoin solution may offer the most opportunities for innovation and economic growth.The idea of some form of FedCoin as a platform not just for smart money but very smart money is appealing in the central bank context as a way to implement the popula-tion-scale electronic cash system required to deliver a national digital currency. This is important because the renewed focus of central banks on the potential for central bank digital currencies should highlight the potential for electronic cash as a platform for new opportunities and a new generation of financial services, not simply a more efficient means to implement domestic retail payments. There is some urgency to this, as the beta testing of a Chinese digital currency is already underway. © Henry Stewart Publications,.},

The authors argue that without careful strategic choices around how digital cash payment schemes will emerge, the uptake and usage of such instruments is likely to be low — despite their potential to promote greater financial inclusion and innovation. The payment scheme represents those elements beyond just the technology that enables transactions to flow between participants. In developing these schemes, four the-oretical options are proposed for central banks to consider, based on two strategic choices. Either central banks take the lead in creating such schemes or leave it to the market to create the schemes. They also need to consider whether to leverage existing schemes or introduce new ones. Based on these two choices, the authors provide four options for central banks: a market-led passive approach; a market-led competitive approach; an authority-led integrative approach; or authority-led develop-mental approach. The choice of option is depen-dent on a number of factors, including (1) the policy imperatives behind introducing digital cash, (2) the competencies that exist within the central bank and (3) the existing electronic payments competition landscape. © Henry Stewart Publications,.},

	abstract = {As the appetite for cash remains unabated, few societies are close to ‘cashless’ or even ‘less-cash’. In fact, demand for cash has risen in most advanced economies since the start of the global financial crisis. People tend to take cash for granted, but the smooth, efficient and secure distribution of cash is actually supported by a complex ecosystem known as the cash cycle. Cash is not always the most efficient payment instrument but, in most cases, it is. Among other things, this interview deals with three major trends aimed at increasing the efficiency of cash. First, central banks have been adapting their cash distribution policies with a view to increasing the velocity of banknote circulation and the efficiency of the cash cycle. Automation has been the second area of innovation. Lastly, numerous other innovations contribute to the efficiency of cash. Cash possesses unique attributes, which are mostly unmatched by alternative payment instruments. At a time when confidence in banks remains low, providing access to a product that consumers want and need could contribute to restoring banks’ the image of banks with the public. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

	abstract = {Adoption of digital payment methods rises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak is affecting how consumers make payments. The majority of customers want to continue using digital payments once the virus has been contained. Global consumers were using them more frequently than they had before the epidemic. The main payment options gaining from this shift are e-Wallets and contactless cards as people use less cash and make more online purchases. Prior to COVID 19, fewer people used digital payment methods worldwide. When Covid-19 spread and physical transactions were on the verge of collapse, digital payments became a reality. This study's primary goals are to evaluate the effectiveness ofonline payment apps used by respondents during Covid 19 and consumer perceptions of the uptake of these methods. Both primary and secondary methods are applied in the process. Structured questionnaires were given to the residents of the Chennai area using the primary data approach. Articles, journals, and various forms of Internet have been utilized in secondary data. The collected data is analysed through Analysis of Variance method. The conclusion of this study shows that people were satisfied that online payment app is more convenient, time saving and easy to adopt. Thoughthere are many barriers in online payment app there were some preventive measures and security.  © 2022 IEEE.},

A case study of the tangibility within cashless payments is presented, which adopted this framework to design, fabricate and test a tangible interaction in digital transactions. Digital transactions can significantly influence a consumer’s spending habits and decisions, commonly leading to increased expenditure compared to cash transactions. Several psychological mechanisms which influence conscientious spending due to differing payment methods were analyzed and employed to design a prototype incorporating a tangible interaction that is relevant to the consumer’s spending process. It is proposed that re-introducing tangibility into the payment process can increase one’s psychological ownership over their financial resources and purchased item, as well as the aversion towards paying. Results from the experiments show that the interaction enhances psychological ownership over digital currency but remain inconclusive on behavior change. The broader implications of enhancing tangibility for intangible objects is discussed. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

Mobile technology has been playing a main role in business via Mobile-Payment applications. Mobile-Payment operates payment when a customer purchases a good or service from a business via trusted third party via Point-Of-Sale (POS) System. So, the payment is through the mobile application without need of using the ATM bank card or credit card directly with POS. However, the customers use Mobile-Payment technology to do a full payment of the purchase, so there will not be any remaining funds that have to be return back to customer. In cash purchases transactions, sometimes there are remaining funds that has to be returned to the customer. The problem sometime, is that there are no cash funds in the business, or exchange of funds to return the balance of the purchase to the customer. Therefore, the proposed system will focus on the use of mobile technology to solve this problem by designing a POS-Debt System to return electronically the remaining of the funds to the Customer Mobile Phone Account that was produced from Telecom Company. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern digital systems in the EEU do not meet the requirements for official methods of transferring funds, and are not appropriate for use in the field of corporate finance. As such, we propose the development of a modified digital system combining the principles and capabilities of traditional and innovative systems based on distributed registry technolo-gy. This should promote integration of national payment systems into the financial sphere under conditions of sanction burden, and low trust in the virtual world. First, we outline the features of corporate cash flows through digital financial assets transfer in a national digital system, and cross-border settlements within a common digital payment space. Next, we describe the possible roles of corporate structures and individuals in payment systems within an EEU common digital payment space. We combine methods of formal logic, historical and comparative analysis, modeling, and graphical interpretation. The study of the digital financial space was carried out on a selection of materials from the Russian Federation, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. Our results illustrate the practical value of a new digital system in reducing the influence of intermediaries, and of inte-grating systems with different types of information into a common database. In addition, we indicate how the prevailing international digital transfer system will accelerate, simplify and reduce the cost of cash flow procedures for organisations. By leveling the need for an international digital unit, such a system will play an intermediary role. We identify the necessary conversion operations to achieve this. The scientific novelty of this study resides in the fact that there is no current analogue for the project proposed herein. As such, we present a large scale and straightforward roadmap for an ambitious and adaptive response to digital development opportunities, social evolution, and financial obstacles. © 2020, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

	abstract = {e-Toll is an electronic card allowing faster and more efficient toll entry payment in Indonesia. In addition to being the first step in modernizing money collection, it is also intended to reduce rule violations since toll officers do not receive direct payments. However, the policy of using e-Toll on the toll road certainly affects the many toll booth employees. The situation as described above occurs at PT. Jasa Marga Purbaleunyi branch, which is engaged in services, especially toll road maintenance services. In this case, this research seeks to further investigate the Professional Transfer Program and its influence on employee psychology at PT. Jasa Marga Purbaleunyi Branch. PT. Jasa Marga has established a cashless policy or the implementation of a non-cash payment system, which is a direct program from the government. With the existence of this policy, Jasa Marga issued a professional transfer policy for employees at the Toll Gate. Based on research results, 82% of the toll booth employees who participated in this program felt that profession change was the right solution for them. It was concluded that the policy was suitable in dealing with the cashless policy. © 2020 SERSC.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces into an overlapping generations model the civil court’s inability to distinguish different qualities of goods of the same kind. This friction prevents the enforcement of real credit contracts through the civil court. Given this environment, fiat money is introduced into the model as an intrinsically useless, but recognizable instrument for the court. With fiat money, there exists an equilibrium in which agents write pledgeable nominal debt contracts, while fiat money circulates as both a means of debt repayment and a means of payment for goods. This result does not require dynamic inefficiency or lack of double coincidence of wants. However, there can occur a shortage of real money balances for debt repayments, because lenders must pay fiat money for borrowers’ output before receiving the repayment of debt, in order for borrowers to obtain fiat money to repay debt. The central bank can resolve this bottleneck if it provides an elastic money supply through a discount window within each period. These results replicate two institutional features of the current monetary system—that is, fiat money being legal tender and a discount window offered by the central bank—in an unified framework. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Abagnale SuperBusinessCheck contains three types of security inks, thermochromic ink, UV ink, and SICPA ink. The dark blue border of the SuperBusinessCheck dissolves when placed in acetone. Some banks have recently added payee name detection to their programs, known as Payee Positive Pay. It is difficult for a bank or an institution to authenticate a check because most checks are processed automatically, or are converted into images before they are ever seen by anyone at the bank.

This paper aims to study e-payment effects on cash by constructing models to forecast value and analyze the structural change of e-payment and cash time series data. The data are a time series of monthly currency in circulation or cash data from January 2005 to September 2019 and e-payment data from January 2010 to March 2019. Using decomposition of components, Holt-Winters' additive method (HW), and ARIMA model, results demonstrate that e-payment is growing because it has an upward trend component. In terms of cash data, it grows upward initially and then continually has a downward trend. The implication is that e-payment growth has affected cash growth while cash is still growing with a decreasing rate. The forecasting models and implications discovered are grounds for conducting further investigations and crafting related policies in the future.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The world witnessed a big evolution in Electronic commerce and Mobile wireless communication technologies during the last 2 decades. Besides, mobile devices penetration rate all over the world is increasing, and the dependence on mobile devices in daily personal and business routines is growing as well. However, Mobile Payments adoption and acceptance is much lower in developing countries compared with developed ones. It is highly recommended for developing countries to increase usage of Mobile Payments especially with the lack of banking services and the presence of privacy and security issues of other payment methods like Credit Cards, and cash. This paper proposes an extension to the mobile payments collaborative model. The proposed model uses the wireless telecommunication technology services of Mobile Network Operators, trust towards banks and the spread of Payments Service Providers and mediators. This model should enable customers to make remote and proximity payments securely and privately any time anywhere under the supervision of governmental authorities. As a result of implementing the proposed model, adoption and acceptance of mobile payments in developing countries might be enhanced to be suitable for a country like Egypt. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

In the Philippines, it is dominated by road vehicles such as jeepneys, taxicabs, Asian utility vehicles, and tricycles, with most if not all, commuters go via multiple carriers for the daily routine. The highly contagious coronavirus has put the world on high alert when it comes to touching high contact public surfaces. When it comes to paying for public transport services by cash, contact is inevitably unavoidable. Recent studies have concluded that the coronavirus can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 3 days depending on the conditions. Interest would be on how drivers and passengers can be protected in the age of coronavirus and beyond. With the growing concern over the safety of drivers and commuters, it would be much advisable to use contactless payments to reduce the risk of transmission. With no obvious end to the outbreak in sight, the study delved on the feasibility of applying the cashless payment system for the multi-carrier commuting public. Results provided a better understanding of the complexities, issues, requisites and benefits of a Multi-Carrier Contactless Payment System for public transportation and all its stakeholders. © IEOM Society International.},

In Germany going out cashless and the idea of paying for coffee with the smartphone seems – at least partly – like science fiction, although research shows that cash is considered “inconvenient”. Starting from a reflection on the two diametrically opposed examples, we attempt to firstly investigate the current payment preferences of German customers, before we secondly elaborate aspects regarding switching to alternative payment methods, i.e., mobile payments. We are wondering: Why do German customers prefer cash payments? and Which factors could affect the switch from cash to mobile payment methods for German customers? To answer these questions, we conducted a three-round Delphi study with eight experts and found, for example, that cash is still preferred because it is more practical as it is accepted by every merchant in Germany. Regarding the switching intentions, one major finding is that large retailers and other key players need to adopt mobile payments as their preferred system, so that customers can become more familiar with it. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Amid the widespread impact of COVID-19, mobile financial services (MFS) have experienced extensive requests due to the failure to perform physical installments and the need for secure transactions. This trend cannot end the utility of cash but it may promote portable monetary administration toward a cashless world. MFS is anticipated to have a bright future as m-commerce increasingly becomes widely known. This study proposes the choice of making a trial and assessment research facility by using a fuzzy model as the most expository device. General forms of a triangular fuzzy number are subjective categories for a linguistic variable. Linguistic variables take on values defined in their term set, that is, the set of linguistic terms. The essential components, including personal innovativeness, transaction completeness, user-friendliness, anonymity, and privacy, are causal competitive advantages of the mobile payment system framework and may play a critical part in reacting to MFS. This study shows that transaction completeness, innovative interface design, privacy, and security facilitate MFS adoption. Furthermore, reliability is necessary to enhance trust in the MFS technology. This study draws on the outcomes of administrative suggestions and recommends a few observational strategies to improve the monetary administration in the MFS industry. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of crime on the use of cash and card payment with an original database of a representative sample of French consumers. We provide empirical evidence that violent and financial crimes have opposite effects on cash withdrawn and cash payment: On the one side, violent crime increases the amount of cash withdrawn and increases the probability of a cash payment. On the other side, financial crime decreases the amount of cash withdrawn and increases the probability of a credit or debit card payment. The probability of mugging is higher when withdrawing cash and automated teller machines (ATMs) deliver only notes. The increase in the amount of cash withdrawn comes from the reduction of the number of cash withdrawals together with the non-linearity of cash withdrawals at ATMs. The increase in the proportion of card owners when financial crime is high is a result of adverse selection: a financial fraudster is more aware of the insurance provided with payment cards, and therefore he places a greater value on having a payment card. © 2015, CIBER Institute.

The responses for the study were composed through a designed questionnaire and informal interaction from 93 street vendors. The respondents were vendors selling a variety of items such as vegetables, fish, milk, coconut, Idli/Dosa, Juice, Vada Pav, Mangoes and Masks. The paper highlights the challenges - technological and otherwise, faced by the vendors in dealing with digital payments in their day to day business transactions. The study indicates that most vendors were receptive to the idea of accepting payments through digital platforms, however the preference for having cash in hand still persists among the majority of the population. To understand the adoption trends of digital payments among the vendor population, hypotheses were constructed around variables such as education, gender and change in income, which were then tested using correlation and chi square techniques. The research emphasizes the need for collective action towards education and awareness measures directed to the vendors, so that a majority of the population could be bought under the gamut of digital literacy. © 2021 IEEE.},

The traditional cash oriented transaction recently has been upgraded to Digital transaction, where the values of currency are transformed in numeric bits. As it provides a fast fund transfer from anywhere and at any time, people prefer various modes of cash-free transactions. Banking sectors in their part involved in developing apps to reduce the load of their consumers. But the problem is, each banking sector either private or public, develops and implements applications exclusively to operate its bank accounts alone. People having multiple bank accounts for various reasons have to make use of all these individual apps. Henceforth, they are forced to remember their confidential details for individual applications. Some researchers have come out with a diversified solution to bring down all the bank accounts to be accessed via a common layer. The major problem is, when a vast amount of data is being integrated, the volume, variety and veracity of data becomes huge which a conventional computing cannot withhold.

This study addresses the characteristics which may be associated with the adoption of relatively novel payment systems and salient user trends in this respect. We investigate whether the reliance on traditional payment methods across European countries is related to socio-economic aspects, and also delve into the payment habits at the individual level. Results from an econometric model suggest that financial market development and education-related factors are negatively related to the use of traditional payment instruments. When considering consumer payment habits and awareness about novel facilities, particular differences across generations emerged. Cash and debit cards are most widely used and it seems that such choices are related to perceived convenience rather than due to aversion towards novel systems. © Oruc M., Batirel A., Trabulus S., 2022.

The subject is the public passenger transport sphere. The author studies buses on municipal regular transport routes (city and suburbs). The category of buses also includes buses of small capacity, i. e. 'Minibuses'. The scientific novelty of the work is to obtain quantitative and qualitative estimates of the extent and consequences of the shadow sector of the provision in the public passenger transport sphere in regions of Russia. The work takes into account a non-cash fare system using debit, credit, transport and social (preferential) cards. It was revealed that in 2018, a non-cash system was installed in 56 regions and in 29 regions was not installed. Based on the panel data analysis, considering endogeneity, AR (1), heteroskedasticity, the work revealed, where the statistical significance at p-value <= 10%, a positive effect of a non-cash fare system on the number of passengers carried on municipal buses and commercial buses. The average annual increase in the number of passengers, as a result of the installation of a non-cash system, amounted to 5840 thousand people. The data obtained showed that from 2014 to 2017, the amount of the shadow revenue of transport organizations was 7,2 billion rubles and the amount of unpaid taxes to the budget ranged from 0,4 to 2,6 billion rubles. The author concludes that the installation of a non-cash fare system leads to a decrease in the shadow economy in the public passenger transport services. © 2020 by the Author(s).},

The Champasak Province, Lao People’s Democratic Republic also implemented this service countrywide. However, the adoption rate of this technology is minimal. That is to say, consumers still preferred to use cash for their purchases rather than QR code payment. Therefore, this paper aims to find the factors affecting the intention to use the QR code payment system of the consumers in Champasak Province. The research model was proposed based on TAM. Three more extended variables were added to the TAM model including Perceived Usefulness, Hedonic Motivation, and Social Influence. This study collected data in the form of a paper-based survey. There were 411 datasets utilized to conduct the hypotheses testing using multiple linear regression. The results suggested that Perceived Usefulness and Social Influence are the two strongest significantly affect the intention to use the QR code payment system. The finding of this study should help the QR code payment system provider to design the system suitable for consumers in Champasak Province. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

It is used not only for identification purpose, but also used as mobile wallets for payment purposes. The ID cards are linked to accounts and users can purchase or make payments by QR code payment system. This gives more convenience to the users as they need not carry cash money everywhere. With this mobile walletsystem, it is easy to transfer money or pay bills, fees etc. A common problem faced in such systems is the risk involved in losing ID card. Anyone who gets access to the lost card can use it illegitimately to pay his own bills. To avoid such problems, a secure authentication system is proposed in this work to identify the legitimate user. In the proposed system, the mobile number of the authorized user is linked to his/her ID card. Whenever the ID card is used for making some payments, an One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to the authorized user’s mobile phone. The user has to enter the OTP and the transaction will be completed only on successful verification of the OTP. If an illegitimate user tries to use the ID card, the card will get blocked. This ensures that the card will not get misused. © BEIESP.},

If the digital cash is transferable then it allows the user to spend an e-coin received in a prior payment immediately without having to contact the bank, that is, the bank remains off-line. In the previous digital cash systems which supported transferability, the digital cash size was growing with each transaction. In this paper, we propose a new digital cash protocol which uses a Forward-Secure Multi-use Unidirectional Proxy Re-signature Scheme to achieve transferability, without any increase in the digital cash size with each transfer. Our scheme enables a secure off-line transaction, thus enforcing user anonymity and transferability.

The adoption of these technical innovations depends, among others, on the acceptance by consumers that can be analyzed with a Lancaster characteristics demand. With a Kranzberg technology matrix, the technical and institutional details of payments can be transformed into salient characteristics of payment instruments that are relevant for Lancaster demand of payment methods. While cash and card-based payments are mostly Kranzberg-complete technologies, novel forms and means of mobile payments lack certain features, i.e., they are Kranzberg-incomplete innovations. Mobile payments are incomplete concerning technical, institutional and regulatory details. As a consequence, this incompleteness may result in a lack of acceptance on the side of consumers since certain salient characteristics of payment methods are not fully developed. In particular, mobile payments are neither widely accepted by merchants, nor are consumers’ data and privacy protected.

	abstract = {The use of the money supply is reflected in the development of the level of demand for money by the public. Due to the increasing demand for money in society, people want a means of payment that can facilitate daily transactions that give rise to the use of electronic money. The use of electronic money is supported by technology that uses an electronic token base that contains a memory module that has a denomination value and serial number and is verified by the relevant institution. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of electronic money on the amount of money supply and the inflation rate. This study uses quantitative methods and uses data obtained from the official websites of BPS and BI. The sample selection method used is 60 samples which are time series data from January 2017 to December 2021. In addition, the data analysis method used is multiple regression analysis. The results showed that e-money along with other variables, namely the BI Rate and Exchange Rate has a positive and significant effect on the money supply as well as inflation is strongly influenced by electronic money along with other variables, namely money supply, BI rate, and exchange rate.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The presence of a marketplace in Indonesia has a direct impact on economic growth, with the existence of a marketplace, people are able to find the desired product and market their products or services as widely as possible. One of the marketplace's flagship services to make it easy for customers to process business transactions is the cash on delivery (COD) payment method. This study analyzes the factors that trigger consumer behavior in the marketplace using the COD payment method. The research model UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) is used to further examine the factors that influence the behavior of marketplace customers who have the intention of using COD transaction services for each transaction. The test uses the structural equation modeling (SEM) with partial least square (PLS) technique. This study obtained 368 respondents as a sample with respondents who have used the COD payment system to collect data using an online questionnaire. The results of the study indicate that hedonic factors, one's habits, price values and social influences are factors that influence a person's intention to use the COD system when shopping online. In addition, intentions arise from behavior when using the COD system. © 2021 IEEE.},

The optimal level of cash in the transaction stems from the interplay between the magnitude of leverage deficit of one or both firms and the scale of synergies, in particular financial, that can be reaped from the acquisition.

	abstract = {Structural changes in the world economy require a constant increase in investment flows. The main factor that determines the presence or absence of resources to finance investment processes is the amount of money in circulation. In this regard, in recent decades, the world financial system has been increasingly faced with the issue of the money supply increase. The process of increasing the currency in circulation should not get out of control; it has to satisfy the needs of world economy sustainable development and at the same time ensure the stability of the international financial markets functioning. Thus, today the issue of finding an international payment facility that would ensure the sustainable development of the world economy on the basis of a controlled growth of the money supply in circulation is an acute one. The way to solve the problem of the money in circulation optimization can be found in so-called cryptographic currencies, the leader among which nowadays is Bitcoin. The purpose of this study is to find the answer to the question: "Can Bitcoin's usage as an international means of payment be a way to solve the issue of the money in circulation optimization in order to maintain sustainable development of the world economy?"

The assessment provides an opportunity not only to identify problems and threats to the CPS, but also to identify areas for further improvement. The effective functioning of the card payment system at the level of individual entities can provide a positive integral effect for the whole society. The article analyzes the world experience in this field, examines the approaches to evaluation used in various countries, as well as the prospects of using the considered approaches and methods in the Russian practice. The author considers the main subjects of the card payment system, their specific evaluation requirements and the corresponding sets of parameters. The author's approach to the definition of the integral social effect of the CPS is proposed. The optimal approach to the assessment, according to the author, is to calculate the main economic indicators of the system using all available techniques and obtain a comprehensive assessment. Comparison of different methods allows more reasonable calculations of the integral effect of the implementation. The economic efficiency of a CPS is assessed at all stages of its formation and operation: at the pre-project stage, the cash flows of the project are preliminary projected, then during the design process, the forecasts are refined, finally, at the stages of implementation and operation, the actual economic effect is determined. To assess the effectiveness of card payment systems from the standpoint of the integral social effect, it is proposed to use the following criteria: social costs of payment transactions, efficiency of retail payments, correct and complex processing of transactions, minimization of systemic financial risks. In the course of the assessment it is necessary to economically justify the calculations for all items of direct and indirect costs and revenues of the CPS. Economic efficiency should be calculated using common quantitative indicators in statics and dynamics. Assessment of the economic efficiency of the CPS is a complex analytical procedure. It should be carried out taking into account the specifics of bank finance, public finance and financing of projects in the field of information technology. © 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {The dynamic development of information and communication technology (ICT) has already impacted the economy, society, culture and politics. As a result, today’s economy characterised by hyper-connectivity, data exchange and automation, is defined as a digital economy. The positive impact of digitalisation is already seen in various industries where digital leaders outperform incumbents. Similarly, the development of the banking industry is strictly connected with digitalisation. The remote access to banking services benefits both customers and banks. Digitalisation influences consumer behaviour, including their payment choices. It is thought to be one of the key factors determining the development of new payment instruments and methods. However, there is still a lack of evidence to what extent it impacts a particular payment instrument’s usage. Thus the purpose of the paper is to determine the relationship between the level of digitalisation and the usage of different payment instruments, including the new ones. The paper applies the DESI Index to measure digitalisation and the data published by NBP and ECB to analyse the usage of payment instruments in the Eurozone and Poland. The structure of the paper is as follows. The first section introduces the research problem, the hypothesis and the methodology. The second section defines digitalisation, its role in the new payment methods’ development and analyses its measures considering their retail payments research application. The third section analyses the relationship between the level of digitalisation and cash and non-cash payments’ usage. The fourth examines the relationship between digitalisation and the innovative payment methods’ usage in POS and remote transactions. The last part of the paper concludes the research findings. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The purpose: The purpose of the article is to identify the causes and consequences of parallel (hybrid) circulation of public (sovereign) and private money in national economic systems. The sovereign money is created as a result of credit operations and transactions on repurchasing assets (bonds) carried out by central banks. This money is in operation in payment systems of central banks. The private money is created during credit operations of commercial banks and credited to their clients’ accounts. The parallel circulation of sovereign and private money results from the development of the money and credit system that ensures, firstly, credit activities, and, secondly, settlements between business entities. The results: The result of study include identifying the specifics and areas of developing the parallel (hybrid) circulation of sovereign and private money substantiated by institutional changes in modern monetary systems, in particular, the emergence of payment systems of central banks and the introduction of Basel standards for the activities of commercial banks. Such changes resulted from the development of money and credit relations in the digital economy that predetermined the acceleration of monetary settlements between business entities. In the modern economy, changes in the ratio of sovereign and private money volumes can have impact on the formation of interest and exchange rates. Main conclusions: The division of money supply formed in the modern economy into sovereign and private money has caused, firstly, the increase in the specialization of monetary system institutions form money supply, and, secondly, has concentrated interbank settlements in the payment system of the central bank in order to ensure stability and guaranteed payments. The current trend in the development of sovereign and private money is to strengthen its integration and interdependence resulting in the intensification of their flows and the correlation of the interest rates set by central banks and the interest rates formed in the interbank lending market, as well as the increasing influence of sovereign and private money supply on the dynamics of foreign exchange rates. The subject: The subject of the work is a hybrid circulation of public and private money. In the modern money and credit system, there is an active interaction between the sovereign money of the central bank and the private money of commercial banks. The determination of the characteristics of the money and credit policy in the context of hybrid circulation of sovereign and private money is a necessary condition for this policy efficiency. The hybrid circulation of sovereign and private money considerably complicates the achievement of the following traditional objectives of the money and credit policy: To form money supply, to ensure the balance between demand for money and money supply, and to maintain interest rates that are adequate to profitability in the real sector, as well as the stability of the exchange rate. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {The correlation of natural and monetary wages is an indicator of the maturity of the capitalist production. The higher is the share of cash in a wage, the more "purified" the relationship between the labour and the capital is supposed to be. This topic received much attention in the classical Marxist analysis of capitalist production. The paper analyzes the categories of wages paid to Siberian mine workers in the late 19th to the early 20th centuries. At that time the market and infrastructure were underdeveloped, and business owners were compelled to provide their employees with lodging, board and other services, reducing the share of cash remaining at the employees' disposal. In Siberian mining industry natural wages which created the conditions for the "secondary" exploitation of workers and engendered social conflicts were almost never substituted for money. In the 19th century Siberia master's board and lodging were a traditional means of payment to employees. In the 1860s to the 1880s the average share of 'master's board and lodging' constituted 40 % of wages in Siberian plants and factories and from 25 to 35 % at goldmines. As the meals provided by the owner were scarce, workers always supplemented them with goods and food from shops belonging to the same owner. In the late 19th century "master's board" was abolished by almost all of businessmen, substituted by the distribution of foodstuffs from shops on account of wages. On the basis of the author's analysis of the reports submitted by enterprises and the results of official inspections, it has been revealed that the share of natural wages at Siberian mines showed no tendency to decreasing. Up to 1917 it constituted on average from 30 to 50 % of the total wages paid to Siberian miners. Workers had to get foodstuffs and other goods from the masters' shops, they were also provided with lodging, medical services, and schooling for children. In the early 20th century the natural component of wages paid to Siberian mine workers was from 3 to 5 times higher than that paid to the workers of European Russia. The author raises a question about the factors accounting for the longtime preservation of natural wages in Siberian mining. He argues that the main reason for it was the weakness of Siberian retail trade which did not penetrate into the mining settlements. The role of retailers was taken on by the enterprises' management. In Soviet times this role was performed by departments of supplies for workers (ORSy). In fact they occupied a monopoly position in this respect and that had the overpricing and lack of quality control as a result. Only enterprises located in Siberia's well-developed areas, in particular mining plants, refused the functions of trade and provision of goods.},

	abstract = {Consumers lack sufficient information and therefore seldom consider the costs of different means of payment when selecting to use cash, debit cards or credit cards. This is because our common means of payment are one of the last services to remain outside normal price competition. The current business model is based on a hidden pricing convention in which the costs of paying are embedded in the prices of purchased goods and services. The lack of transparent pricing limits competition, steers towards a less efficient use of payment alternatives and delays payment service developments. A transparent business model for payment services would make the benefits of development and change visible and, as a result, would most likely lead to cost savings via more efficient selection of instruments and increased competition in the market.},

Futurologists predict that the future society will be a cashless society, one without the circulation of physical cash. In particular, IT utilization in the finance and industrial sectors and the proliferation of e-commerce have accelerated the emergence of electronic cash. The use of electronic cash in the SNSs (Social Network Services) has become greatly appealing to the younger generation. In Korea, the variety of implementations of electronic cash has been increasing steadily since 2000. For example, the T-Money transport card, which is prepaid or postpaid electronic cash, is a popular transport card widely used throughout Korea, and its use will be expanded as it becomes integrated T-Money starting in 2016. The postpaid T-Money transport card has developed into a mobile payment system in recent years and has become increasingly popular in Korea. In this paper, the design and implementation of an in-house mobile payment system of electronic cash is presented. The mobile electronic cash for in-house use is an electronic cash system that is exclusively used within a single organization; the system was implemented by using mobile payment as the payment method. © 2016 SERSC.},

Cognizance of the fact that an improved exchange mechanism and payment system is central to the survival and growth of Nigerian economy which had suffered severe recession between 2015 and 2019, it applied survey research design to poll 204 bank workers from four banks in Nigeria to ascertain their perception on the extent to which the cashless policy has addressed the problem of exchange and payment system in Nigeria. The independent variable was cashless policy while the dependent variables were cash based transactions; modernization of payment system; and volume of cash outside the formal economy. Using Correlation Coefficient with SPSS 10 the test of hypotheses showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between the cashless policy and the development and modernisation of the payment system (i.e. p < 0.05 at 0.05 significance level) while it has significantly trimmed down the volume of cash in the informal sector in Nigeria by nearly 32% among others. It was concluded that the cashless policy has significantly and positively improved exchange and payment system in Nigeria. as well as reduced drastically the volume of cash in the informal sector of the economy including reducing significantly the number of cash based transactions in the economy. It was recommended inter alia, that the monetary authorities should embark on a second phase of the policy to bring more transactions under the cashless policy. © IAEME Publication.},

	abstract = {The Coronavirus pandemic is a turning point for the payment industry, as those businesses have invested heavily in digital and mobile prosperity. During the coronavirus pandemic, digital payments kept economies going and helped to minimize people’s exposure to the virus. E-wallet is an electronic device or online service that enables electronic transactions to be made by a person. The applicant can store funds and that money will be used to make payments to pay taxes, to buy food, to book a ticket, and some others. It is still new to the Malaysian especially at rural areas for instance in Kemaman, Terengganu. Consumers in rural areas are still using cash payment rather than e-wallet due to the lack of awareness and knowledge of the system. This study found the factor affecting the intention to use the e-wallet based on the theory of acceptance and use of technology which are social influence, perceived security, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Methodology: This study used a qualitative and quantitative method such as interview and observation (qualitative) to verify of questionnaires (quantitative). The respondents were from 18 to 46 years and above who use debit card or cashless payment to make transaction. Then for analysing data we used SPSS20. Findings: The study found that 89% of respondents know and use e-wallets for shopping, prepaid/postpaid payments, and other utilities. The result showed that the factor of perceived ease of use of e-wallet is high compared to others. This means that the Malaysia rural community also knows that e-wallet application eases their way of doing some purchasing online because they were able to buy anytime without worry anymore about Coronavirus infection. However, e-wallet is still challenging for elderly to understand the process from the beginning of the download of the application, setting it in the smart-phone, choosing the product or shop, and controlling their cash flow. Application: Today, people need a fast, simple, and secure way to get everything’s done right. Therefore, the easiest and most secure way to buy and pay is through e-wallet. Instead of knowing, people at the rural area are interested in using e-wallet as the improvement bring enjoyable and comfortable instruction provided. Thus, shoppers also need to prepare all types of payment transactions if there are people who choose to pay with e-wallet instead of cash or card. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this paper, we propose a new fair blind signature scheme with message recovery using the self-certified pairing-based public key cryptosystem. Preserving the merits inherent in the pairing-based cryptosystem, it can possess fewer bits to achieve the higher security level. In addition, our new scheme has the advantage that the authentication of the public key can be accomplished with the verification of the fair blind signature in a logically single step due to the use of the self-certified public key cryptosystem. Furthermore, the fairness of blind signature with message recovery can be actually achieved in our proposed scheme. Based on the proposed security proofs and performance evaluation, we affirm that we not only improve the efficiency of the previously proposed schemes, but also achieve the essential properties of blind signature with provable security. © 2012 ICIC International.},

	abstract = {In 1983, the Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division in the United States Department of Justice, Bill Baxter, did something that would be unfathomable today. He published an academic paper in a scholarly journal that related directly to a piece of antitrust litigation then pending in federal court in which he had served as an expert. The paper did not ignite a storm of controversy. Indeed, outside of the court presiding over the litigation to which Baxter's article related, Baxter's paper attracted little immediate attention. Even twelve years ago, when a group of friends and colleagues gathered to celebrate Baxter's work, this paper took a distant back seat to his tenure at the Department of Justice, his monograph on environmental law, and his one article on choice of law. Today, the paper is recognized as the seminal work on a topic that has attracted considerable attention for the last several years and seems likely to remain on the public agenda in the United States and elsewhere for the indefinite future: interchange. The consensus on Baxter's paper ends there. There is considerable disagreement about what Baxter's paper actually says. For example, Jean Charles-Rochet & Jean Tirole credit Baxter for observing (1) that the decision to use a payment type requires coordination between the consumer and the merchant, (2) that the merchant and consumer in a four-party payment system may be served by different payment institutions, and (3) that maximization of output frequently requires a transfer from one side of the system to the other.1 Dennis Carlton extracts a different lesson from Baxter. According to Carlton, Baxter's paper demonstrates that interchange can be used to enable merchants to charge two sets of prices: A higher price for cash customers and a lower price for credit customers.2 The various interpretations of "Bank Interchange of Transactional Paper" flow from two omissions in the paper that a contemporary reader will notice-a formal model and discussion of the work of other economists. Baxter's article has none of the former and very little of the later. It precedes by a few years the modeling revolution of Industrial Organization, and like other famous and roughly contemporaneous articles,3 it makes little effort to explain where it stands in relation to the contributions of other economists. Baxter's article limits its discussion of the work of other economists to two short footnote discussions of an article by Bowen entitled The Interpretation of Voting in the Allocation of Economic Resources and the classic article by Landes and Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases. With some trepidation,4 this essay attempts to make the going easier. It provides a short map of the paper. It also fills in some of the obvious holes in Baxter's article and flags portions where an unwary reader might get trapped. Baxter's article, like a proverbial Michelin-starred restaurant, is worth the trip. But it is also worth attempting to smooth an otherwise bumpy journey.

According to this, one of the most important dangers to online security nowadays is fraudulent transactions. Suspicious trans-action monitoring should therefore be an essential component of any payment system. Fraud transactions can be detected by evaluating consumer habits from past transaction data.

	abstract = {In Ireland, there was a bank strike that led to a complete shut-down of the main part of the banking system from May to November 1970. The effects of this strike were surprisingly limited. This had led some observers to conclude that trade credit can easily substitute for bank deposits as a means of payment. In this paper, it is shown how cash and cheques were used as substitutes and complements allowing for “business as usual” for an extended period of time. This paper argues that such a situation would not have prevailed much longer. The lack of a proper settlement mechanism implied that risks were rising for almost all transactors. In order to contain risks the use of trade credit would have declined and economic performance would have deteriorated progressively. © 2018, Duncker und Humblot GmbH. All rights reserved.},

In turn, due to the rapid progress, the issue of electronic money is becoming increasingly relevant, attracting the attention of lawyers, economists, and society as a whole. The purpose of this study is to analyse the legal status of electronic money, its advantages and disadvantages, considering the practice of the European Union in this matter. The study used a complex of philosophical and worldview general scientific and special scientific methods. The formal-logical method was used to define the basic concepts and legal categories related to the analysis of the legal status of electronic money in Ukraine. The historical method was used to highlight the process of development and establishment of legal regulation of electronic money in Ukraine. The method of systems analysis allowed to identify and formulate the main conclusions and recommendations for increasing the efficiency of cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union in the field of legal regulation of electronic money. Furthermore, when determining the legal status of electronic money, it is important to consider the legislation of the European Union. The study also analyses the differences in the legal status of electronic money from non-cash, virtual, and digital money. © 2020 Lifescience Global},

	abstract = {One of the most relevant and widely discussed trends in the financial sector is the development of a new payment technology – ​central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDC is central bank-issued digital money denominated in the national unit of account, and it represents a liability of the central bank. It differs from electronic reserves (which cannot currently be accessed by individuals), physical cash, cryptocurrencies and other private digital tokens. Central banks around the world have been researching the concept and design of CBDC for several years and their work continues apace amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This general trend encompasses large differences across jurisdictions and types of economies. Each country should make its own choice of the CBDC design, taking into account its particular circumstances. Over the last years, the share of central banks actively engaging in some form of CBDC work has increased significantly. Central banks are moving from conceptual research of CBDC to experimentation and pilot projects. CBDC projects differ starkly across countries, both in their motivations and their economic and technical design. Rising number of central banks are considering retail CBDC rather than wholesale, and “hybrid” or “intermediated” operational architectures where the CBDC is a direct claim on the central bank, but the private sector manages customer-facing activity. The paper reviews the recent advances in CBCD projects, and the experience of the countries in more advanced stages of CBCD engagement, namely the particularly advanced CBDC Chinese project of the e-yuan of the People’s Bank of China and Swedish e-krona project of Sveriges Riksbank. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

While an existing VMX theory solved the fairness problem in a VERA algorithm based on a Pareto exchange point [3], a new expecation problem has been found such that exchange requesters might submit minimum acceptable rates (MAR) to determine whether to accept VMX systems-generated virtual currency exchange rates. When exchange requestors think the systems-generted rates are lower than MAR, they select not to accept the systems-generated rates. The withdrawal of systems-generated rates creates the expectation problem such that the fairness has been lost due to Pareto exchange point no longer exists. To solve the expectation problem, this paper has developed a new VERA-RS algorithm by extending the existing VERA algorithm based on a newly developed formal expectancy model and a novel m-stage and n-phase three-level computing framework. VERA-RS algorithm has solved expectation problem by achieving a set of satisfied virtual currency exchange rates. © 2013 IEEE.},

When this kind of cash is used, the fraud such as double spending can be found out but the bank and the trusted party needs not be involved online in each transaction. This cash system is anonymous in normal transactions. But if a fraud happens, the trusted party can withdraw the anonymity to find out the cheater. The new cash scheme is transferable, anonymous, off-line and efficient. © 2008 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

This phenomenon means that the central bank can not dominate the money supply practically, thus slack policy on the application of electronic money and virtual money should be put in force if it does not harm the nation's financial security. © 2009 IEEE.},

Following on from the physical use of credit and debit cards, bills can now be simply paid by phone or via the internet by the average consumer. This paper explores the privacy issues that arise as a result of the burgeoning electronic payment system over the internet. When trading using cashless mediums of exchange, record keeping functionally replaces cash. These ubiquitous records imperil privacy. A privacy issue arises with the collection of private information, despite whether it is used or not. Authorised use by authorised parties does not necessarily mean that privacy is protected. Non authorised uses by either authorised or non authorised parties are direct threats to privacy. Protection methods such as encryption software are compromised by market forces which drive the sale of the software, making protection a moving technical target. Legislators in America have allowed this situation by making the sales legal. Legislation changes so far are not seen to be sufficient to protect privacy related to cashless mediums of exchange on the internet.},

	abstract = {Electronic Commerce is playing a growing importance on modern Economy since it provides a commodity way for consumers to acquire goods and services through electronic means - Internet and the WWW are the most important. However, this new way of trade raises important problems on the way payments are being made, and trust is one of the most important one. This paper starts by presenting some of the complexities related to Electronic Commerce payments in this New Economy, both on a consumer and seller perspective. Next, differences between the traditional and electronic payment systems are identified and how they both deal with the identified complexities. Electronic payment systems (EPS) are then identified referring the advantages presented to Electronic Commerce. Finally, a comparative EPS table is presented identifying strong and week points on each of the EPS and conclusions are drawn from this.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an electronic retail payment system to provide flexible and efficient funds transfers with adequate security, reliability, circulativity, and anonymity even in large-scale applications. Funds are represented by a portable intelligent device called a card issued by a supervising organization, the system provider. Funds can be transferred from a card to another at an intelligent terminal called a mediator. To update the balance of each card, two digital signatures are generated by a three-party protocol conducted by the cards and mediator, and are encoded and appended to a write-once separate memory in the card. Old signatures are simultaneously nullified. Through a wired or radio non-real-time link, the generated signatures are periodically reported to the system provider to systemically manage possible abuses.},

	abstract = {Electronic payment systems are well-understood to be an essential step on the road to electronic commerce, and are thus in high demand. There has been a strong effort in developing secure untraceable off-line electronic cash protocols since Chaum proposed the first e-cash system in 1991 and some systems are now in use. However, there are still many open problems in the field of e-payment system research. The basic problems with all electronic payment systems for issuers of e-cash are to prevent double spending and to prevent kidnap and laundering. For the using of credit card in transaction is very popular, it is proper to design e-payment system based on smart card. There are many researchers making great efforts to do this work and gain some useful results. An efficient fair payment system by electronic wallet is presented. Users in the system have only one personal account in the bank. In the withdrawal protocol, the user gives a correctly constructed message for possibly coin tracing to the bank and gets a blind signature on his identity from the bank. In the payment protocol, with the help of tamper-resistance card, the user proves to the shop that he spends a valid e-cash and sends a correctly constructed message for possibly owner tracing to the shop. A valid e-cash can be deposited to the bank by the shop. If a user spends an e-cash more than one times, with the help of the Trustee, the bank can find the user easily. Unlike other systems, the Trustee in this system is off-line entirely, it does not need to be involved in any protocols except the owner-tracing and coin-tracing protocols. The security of the system is based on the discrete logarithm problem. Upon the analyses, it indicates that the system is secure and efficient.},

Especially, in this paper we have designed a partially blind signature scheme for efficiently securing e-cash based payment systems using the self-certified public key cryptosystem based on ECC.

	abstract = {Despite the potential of micro-payment systems very few systems have been successful. Micro-payment markets exhibit two-sided network externalities and the business models for these markets are not very well understood. By using a parsimonious game theoretic model, this paper studies factors affecting the existence of a market for micro-payment systems, how the users and merchants choose their acceptance levels, and how a profit maximizing system provider sets the prices under the presence of two-sided network effects. We find that there is a ‘survival mass’ of merchants and users for the market to exist and a ‘critical mass’ for the acceptance levels to take off and remain stable. There is also a lower bound for the user and merchant demands. The conditions for the existence of the market are derived. We find the non-intuitive result that lowering the user-side adoption cost will actually hurt the chances for the micro-payment market to exist. Anecdotal evidence supports this. We also find that to achieve full acceptance levels, the system provider needs to subsidize both users and merchants, which is not feasible in practice. © 2004, Association for Information Systems.

Since then this vision of 'Electricity for all' has begun to accelerate into a reality. The price structure discussed in this paper is a first step towards developing this market which otherwise may have remained untapped for some time. The pre-payment system enables future electricity sales to take place on a cash basis in line with prospective customers' traditional and preferred way of paying for goods in advance. While they are able to control their own electricity consumption, customers also have the opportunity to develop an understanding of the cost of electricity compared to traditional alternative energy sources.},

Using the recent cointegration techniques of Park (1992) and Johansen (1988), we find strong support for the long-run stability of this alternative money demand specification.

It has many applications in such areas as electronic cash payment systems, secure and authenticated key establishment, secure multi-casting over the Internet, authenticated key recovery, etc.. In secure and authenticated group communication there is a need for threshold generation of signcryption. In this paper, we propose a protocol for threshold generation of signcryption using the techniques of verifiable secret sharing (VSS) and secure multi-party computation (MPC). In the protocol, any t or more honest members can efficiently generate valid signcryption text of a given message, while the adversary whole corrupts up to t - 1 group members cannot forge any valid signcryption text. The protocol of computing reciprocals of secrets presented by R. Gennaro, S. Jarecki, H. Krawczyk, and T. Rabin is also modified so that the efficiency is improved.},

Unconditional anonymity, however, is also very well suited to support criminals in blackmailing. Recently Kügler and Vogt [6] proposed a payment system based on the blind undeniable signature that protects the privacy of the users and defeats blackmailing with the assumption that the victim of a blackmailing can inform the Bank of a blackmailing before delivering the money and transfer the decryption key(i.e. the secret key of the victim) used in confirmation protocol without being detected by a blackmailer. But the assumption that the victim is always able to inform the bank of blackmailing is very impractical in such cases as kidnapping and special impersonation. In this paper, we propose two practical methods that gives the Bank the information about blackmailing and decryption key without any unpractical assumptions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship and effect of changes in economic variables on the use of different payment instruments in South Africa. Specifically, it examines whether the use of individual payment instruments increases or decreases when there is a change in economic fundamentals. This issue is made pertinent due to the fact that banks and merchants wish to increase the use of electronic payment instruments and phase out the use of cheques and cash. We find that changes in economic indicators affect the use of different payments instruments. This has implications for economic policy and financial sector development.},
